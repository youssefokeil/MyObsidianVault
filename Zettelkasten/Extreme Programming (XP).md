# Extreme Programming (XP)
>Suitable for developing software with constantly evolving or unclear requirements.

- is an [[Agile]] method embodies lots of its characteristics 
- not a prescriptive method for step-by-step software construction.

### Values
**Three main values**
1. **communication**
2. **simplicity**
	 within every challenging systems lies a simpler system that is overlooked.
3. **feedback**
	 continuous feedback from stakeholders, to mitigate risks such as changing requirements and evolving programming technologies.
### Principles
**The primary principles to bridge the gap between the abstract values and the pragmatic practices.**
1. **Peopleware**
	managing people, their expectations, growth, motivation and responsibilities.
2. **Economics**
	delivering economic results is very important to secure, the often substantial, financial investment.
3. **Mutual Benefits**
	 make decisions that benefit multiple stakeholders.
	 - Company ensures good work environment, so team delivers software that adds value
	 - Refactoring makes code cleaner to understand for both the original developer and future maintainers.
4. **Continuous Improvement**
	- no design phase as design is incremental
	- the programming practices should be continually evaluated; teams should allocate time to discuss and reflect on them
5. **Failures happen**
	- should not punish developers for failures and bugs as failures are inevitable
	- confronting failures is an integral part of the process
6. **Baby Steps**
	The focus should be advancing the project in the right direction
	- secure, tested and validated progress is better than large increments
	- daily code integration is preferable
	- refactoring should occur in small steps interspersed with running tests
7. **Personal Responsibility**
	every developer must have a clear understanding of their roles and responsibilities within the team.
