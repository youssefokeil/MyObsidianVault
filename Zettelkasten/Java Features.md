# Java Features
1. All code blocks (loops, functions, classes) must be between curly braces `{}`.
2. All code that **runs** must be inside the main function  `public static void main(String[] args)`.
3. All code lives within classes. Even functions, must be defined within classes.
4. Boolean expressions are contained within parentheses. Ex: `if(x==5)`.
5. Java is a [[Statically Typed Language]]. Meaning you have to declare variables at the beginning and not change its type as long as program lives.


Check [[Readable & Documented Code]] to check for style recommendations when wrioiting your code.
