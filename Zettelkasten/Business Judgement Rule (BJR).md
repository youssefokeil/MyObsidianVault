# Business Judgement Rule (BJR)
>Protects board directors from legal liability of their actions impact a stake holder. Despite them having to act according to their fiduciary duty.

### Why?
It insulates directors from second-guessing by courts in absence of BJR protections, which would lead them to prefer low-risk investments.
### Applied When?
- Fraud
- Gross Negligence
	channel to hold a director responsible, if a director failed to use all information and use sound judgement, stakeholders will have a case that bypasses the BJR.
- Conflict of interest impacts a decision
