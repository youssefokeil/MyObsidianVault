# Reinforcement Learning Tasks

## Episodic Tasks
we have a starting point and ending point (a terminal state. Like a racing need for speed game, starts and ends at the finish line

## Continuing Tasks
Tasks that don't end and don't have terminal states.

## Stochastic Tasks
is a task that involves randomness in its environment, outcomes or execution. In reinforcement learning this may mean that if an agent did the same action twice, it may not lead to the desired outcome due to the randomness in the environment.
