# Queue
> is a FIFO data structure, deletion occurs at front and insertion occurs at end of queue.

---
## Used for:
- Resource allocation
- CPU scheduling (especially [[Round Robin]] techniques)
- Graph and tree reversal
---

## Implementation:
- Enqueue: adds element to the end of the queue
- Dequeue: removes elements from the front of the queue
- getFront: returns copy of the front of the queue

Queues are made using [[Arrays]] or [[Linked Lists]].

## Complexity:
Enqueue, dequeue all take O(1)
