# Baseline
It's the result of making a very simple model (the smaller and simpler, the better). You do the baseline then try more complex approaches and see if your results improve.
### Reasons to make a baseline:
1. Provides an indication of what is possible.(If the baseline has 5% error rate we know for sure that we can better than this)
2. A great way to know if we're moving in the right direction, because we have something to compare to.
3. We learn thing on our model, like whether our model has unbalanced classes.
4. Validates whether we can make something bug free:
	- If it roughly makes sense, move on to the next phase.
	- If it's nonsensical, check if you know the problem domain or whether you have a bug.
