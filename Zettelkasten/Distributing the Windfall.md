# Distributing the Windfall
### Considerations:
1. Effectiveness 
	to achieve desired goals
	1. Maximizing amount of good per dollar
	2. Or just minimizing harms caused by AI
	3. Must have a good geographical scope. Should poorer states have quick aid? Should all states get the same chunk of the windfall? Should it be distributed per capita?
2. Accountability
	to moderate how powerful actors might influence the distribution of wealth
	1. Transparency and reporting to third parties
	2. Rewarding whistleblowers, and transactions must be approved by at least two people
	3. Review by external public or private entities
	4. Incentive to use funds an effective way
3. Legitimacy
	all people have voice in ensuring their needs are heard and addressed
	1. Allowing popular election of windfall decision-makers
	2. International or intergovernmental organization influence windfall spending
	3. Consensus mechanisms to guide windfall spending
4. Firm Buy-in
	we need firms to cooperate. Way to promote firms' interests.
	1. Publicizing firms' commitments to the clause
	2. Allow firms to have some influence over the windfall spending 

### Note
Doesn't in making firms have some influence over windfall spending, contradict accountability by it not moderating how powerful actors might influence the distribution of wealth? Why does firms influence over spending help firm buy-in?
