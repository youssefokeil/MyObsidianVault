# Semi-conductors
are materials whose conductivity lie between conductors and insulators. Examples: Gallium-Arsenide GaAs, [[Silicon Si]], Germanium Ge.

### Why Semi-conductors:
1. **Electrical conductivity can be changed by:**
- Introducing extrinsic dopant atoms (useful in P-N junction)
- Conductivity can be changed by introducing light (useful in cameras). See [[Photoelectric Effect]].
- Changed by the variation of temperature (useful in temperature sensors)
2. **Have two types of carriers (electrons and holes).**
