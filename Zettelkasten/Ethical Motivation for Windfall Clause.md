# Ethical Motivation for [[Windfall Clause]]
1. Historically, economic progress from innovations has not arrived equitably or smoothly, there's a very high probability that we'll have [[Concentrated AI Wealth]];
		Ex: key technologies from the Industrial Revolution, like factory mechanization, steam power and railroads, generated enormous amount of wealth that accrued to only a few countries and individuals.
	-  It will compensate those rendered faultlessly unemployed due to advances in technology.
	- AI can be a general-purpose technology. One that is compared to electricity & the internal combustion engine. This means that AI is going to disrupt existing industries over the next decades and will bring enormous economic wealth to small number of firms.
	- Human-level AI can substitute human labor for majority of economic tasks and can cause a level of inequality like nothing else in history.
2. Providing AI labs with a credible mechanism to demonstrate their commitment to pursuing advanced AI for the common good. Especially, due to the public debate on the social responsibilities of large tech companies to serve the interests of society at large.
3. It can serve to address the loss of job possibility;
	- There is a strong consensus that most, if not all, human work can be automated.
	- The rapid pace of progress, can outpace the workers' ability to retrain. Because, by the time he has retrained, his new skills will be obsolete and irrelevant.
	- On the long run, the near-complete automation of human labor will make AI systems a substitute of human labor not a complement to it.
	- The problem isn't only the unemployment of humans but their _unemployability._
4. Address the reduction opportunities for developing countries to develop via industrialization and providing human labor;
	1. AI systems will eliminate the advantage of their advantage in labor-intensive manufacturing activities, by substituting human labor.
	2. [[Global Value Chains]], make it harder for low-income countries to offset their technological disadvantage by their labor advantage. Because it's hard to substitute unskilled labor for other production inputs i.e. other countries are specialized in those inputs.
	3. If automation eliminates opportunities in developed countries, there might be no demand for goods produced by developing countries.
5. Smooth the transition towards Advanced AI. Regulation will become increasing difficult on existing institutions as the AI revolution starts.
