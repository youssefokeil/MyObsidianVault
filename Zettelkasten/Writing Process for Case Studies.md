# Writing Process for Case Studies
> Writing cases is a challenging task, but it has great learning outcomes. 

### 1. Planning:
> establishment of a scheme that lays out important actions in writing a case. 
- Identifying the purpose of the case writing task:
	- In educational setting, it is the learning outcomes and the purpose is instructional
- Identifying the learners:
	- you have to find common ground between you and the readers and exploit it.
	- You have to ask how much do your readers know about the subject?
	- Take care with your word-choice and as a rule of thumb try to be clear as possible and add resources.
- Decide how much and what information should be put into the case.

### 2. Organizing:
- Case studies in a narrative format: who was involved, what happened, why it happened and how.
- Different perspectives.
### 3. Drafting:
putting your words to paper:
- Don't deviate much from the subject matter. 
- Ask what is the central idea of the case? 
	- usually emerges during the planning phase
- How can the central idea be supported?

### 4. Revision:
1. Will the case produce the intended learning outcomes?
2. Are the problem issue(s) presented in the case related to the learning outcomes? 
3. Is the case sufficiently complete, complex and focused? 
4. Does the case present a situation, problem, or issue? 
5. Does the case appear to be realistic? 
6. Are all the elements of a narrative style used in the case (i.e., a storytelling style, the contextual descriptions of the situation, the portrayals of the central characters, the development of a series of events, and an interesting plot evoking different perspectives)? 
7. Are the events and actions in the case sequenced in a logical order? 
8. Are the events connected with appropriate transitional signals? 
9. Is the content in the case accurate, relevant, and appropriate in terms of subject matter? 
10. If there are external resources, are they appropriate?
