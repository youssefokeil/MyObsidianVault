# I-V characteristics of Diode
## Ideal diode
- Open circuit in reverse bias and short circuit in forward bias. 
- This curve is nonlinear but is considered piecewise linear, meaning it's made up of two(or more) linear curves

## Real diode
The common implementation of diodes is a _pn junction_. It's no surprise as pn junctions conducts substantial current in forward direction and very small saturation current in reverse.
