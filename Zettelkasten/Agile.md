# Agile Processes
>To address the problems posed by the [[Waterfall Processes]],  Agile recommends building software incrementally and iteratively, with validation by users at every iteration.

### Agile Methods
- Various Methods have been derived from these principles like [[Extreme Programming (XP)]], [[Scrum]], [[Kanban]].
- Promoted automated testing
- test-driven development
	writing tests before the actual code
- continuous integration
	Recommends that developers push the code to the main repository continuously (every day, for example). To avoid integration conflicts.
### Characteristics:
- Short and iterative development cycles.
- Incremental development:
	1. First version of the system is made with the most critical features.
	2. This version is validated by the customer
	3. If approved, a new cycle called iteration or sprint begins. With a few more features.
	 __NB:__ Cycles are short and usually take two weeks.
- Less emphasis on documentation; only essential information for maintaining the systems is important.
- Less emphasis on detailed plans. Neither the customer nor the designer have a clear understanding  of all requirements that should be implemented.
	- Progress even when having incomplete, partial and changing requirements.
	- Understanding oof the systems gradually unfolds as sprints are completed and validated.
- No dedicated design phase.
- Small teams (10-12) developers
- Use of new programming practices; automated testing, refactoring and continuous integration.
