# Kyoto Protocol
> Is an [[Ex-Ante Agreement]]. It only binds developed countries and places a burden on them. Under the principle of [[Climate Justice]], as it realize that they're largely responsible for climate change.

It binds 37 industrialized countries and the EU. For reduction of emission targets, [Kyoto Protocol - Targets for the first commitment period | UNFCCC](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-kyoto-protocol/what-is-the-kyoto-protocol/kyoto-protocol-targets-for-the-first-commitment-period). Those targets add up to a cut of 5.2% of Greenhouse gas emissions.

### Mechanisms:
The mechanisms for the Kyoto Protocol were market-based and flexible. Implementing things like the [[Emissions Trading]] for countries to buy from other countries that managed to reduce emissions beyond what they were bound to do.

### Criticism:
- The commitments are "modest" and it should've had deeper cuts in emissions
- Lots of environmentalists only are supporting the Kyoto Protocol as a first step toward more regulation and future commitment to have bigger reductions.
	- In 2001, seventeen national science academies stated that ratification of the Protocol represented a "small but essential first step towards stabilising atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419074652/https://royalsociety.org/~/media/Royal_Society_Content/policy/publications/2001/10029.pdf)
- Fails to include developing countries from bearing responsibility. 
- In fact, the ultimate criticism of the Kyoto protocol is that global emissions are still increasing relative to 1990 levels to this day and much of this increase is driven by the very countries that were excluded from reduction targets under the Protocol
- a lack of any significant kind of punishment or sanctioning mechanism when countries do not stick to their climate pledges.
### Legacy:
The Kyoto Protocol was directly responsible for much of the architecture for later climate negotiations including the Paris Agreement and its legacy includes mechanisms such as the:
- Carbon Markets
- [[Adaptation Fund]]
