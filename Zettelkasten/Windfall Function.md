# Windfall Function
Defines signatories' obligations under varying profit levels.

### Desiderata:
Important pragmatic considerations outline a number of desirable features.

| Desideratum                         | Description                                                                       | Justification                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Transparency & reducing ambiguities | Determining whether a signatory has met their obligations is easy.                | Provides public relation benefits, makes the Clause more enforceable & greater accountability      |
| Scale-sensitivity                   | Amount owed depends on the size of the company in relation to the global economy. | Maintains focus on relative windfall. As global economy might grow in a faster-than-typical rates. |
| Adequacy                            | The amount owed under Clause is proportionate to challenges it seeks to address.  | Respects importance of policy motivations for Clause                                               |
| Pre-windfall agreement              | Firms owe small amounts as they approach windfall profits.                        | Demonstrates the firms' commitment to the Clause.                                                  |
| Incentive Alignment                 | Incentive for firms to earn more profits.                                         | Mitigates concerns that Clause will stifle innovation.                                             |
| Competitiveness                     | Firms remain competitive to non-signatory firms                                   | Prevents perverse effect of non-signatories to out-compete beneficent signatories.                 |
### A Possible Function:

| Bracket (% of GWP) | Marginal Clause Obligation |
| ------------------ | -------------------------- |
| 0-0.1%             | 0%                         |
| 0.1-1%             | 1%                         |
| 1-10%              | 20%                        |
| 10-100%            | 50%                        |
- Second bracket obligation (1%) is close to what Fortune 500 companies already give in philanthropy. [Corporate Cash Giving Rises 5%, Exclusive Chronicle Survey Shows](https://www.philanthropy.com/article/corporate-cash-giving-rises-5-exclusive-chronicle-survey-shows/)
- Companies with profits greater than 1%, have obligation that matches a corporate tax rate.
### Possible Variations
1. Alter thresholds and marginal giving obligations associated with various brackets.
2. Base obligations other than proportional profits. 
	1. Absolute profits, but it won't account for economic growth
	2. Market cap, but it would oblige a firm to pay even if it gets 0 profits.
3. Obligations on the basis of the firms' financial position at point where it agrees to Clause.
	 Company that has a high probability of achieving windfall to agree on smaller obligations
4. Giving shares of stock instead of dollar amounts to a nonprofit entity.
5. Strict caps on profit "capped-profit"
	1. for example OpenAI puts cap of 100 times initial investment for first-round investors. If an individual share of stock makes 120x initial investment the rest of the 20x will go to the windfall clause.
6. Accommodate for taxations of the signatory; if a company already pays a lot of taxes already (companies in the EU like Mistral AI), it should pay less to the windfall clause.
