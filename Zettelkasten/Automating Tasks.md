# Automating Tasks
Large Language Models are used:
- Evaluate applications
- Summarize meetings, books, articles.
- Respond to answers instead of humans.

#### Impact on World Economy
_Current Generative AI_ can add $2.6-4.4 trillion annually to the _current_ $100 trillion economy.  AI companies can capture 25% from that growth from API access. This underestimates what AI can be used to in general.

#### Replacing Human Labor
Future AI systems may be able to do work without that "glue" code like API calling, etc...
- 46% of US wages can be done remotely.
- This percentage can be bigger in other EU companies.
Under that premise entire teams can be automated with AI. Massively upscaling the impact of companies. Maybe OpenAI will hire 300 more expert-level AI to help as OpenAI capabilities researchers.
