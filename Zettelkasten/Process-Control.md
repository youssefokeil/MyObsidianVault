# Process-Control
>In process control, the objective is to regulate the quantity at a specific value; also called the set-point or reference. To regulate is to maintain, despite external  influences.

### Example:
In our reference the example was to regulate the level of the liquid at a required level. The problem was approached by 3 solutions:
1. **Self-regulation** :
	It won't regulate at a specific level, it just reaches equilibrium by letting the input flow-rate = output flow-rate

2. Human-aided control:
	The human evaluates the controlled variable(water level) and manipulates in the output flow rate till we reach the needed level.

3. Automatic control
	What we are concerned with studying by using sensors and control elements.
