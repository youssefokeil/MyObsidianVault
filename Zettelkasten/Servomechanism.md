>It's a system where you use error-sensing feedback to control the position, velocity or acceleration or any specific variable of a mechanism.  

## Servo problem:
 **Tracking problem:**  
	also called the servo problem, is concerned with making the system approach the reference signal whatever its initial-state was. The system follows the variation of the reference value. In a way the system is trying to follow a track instead of approaching a specific setpoint. (Ex: Antenna following satellite, Flight following a specific track, A robot following a specific track)
