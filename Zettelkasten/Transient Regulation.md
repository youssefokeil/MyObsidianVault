# Transient Regulation
>Transient regulation specifies how the control system responds to a sudden transient event. 	
### Types:
There are two types of events that can happen in a control system that need transient regulation:
- **Set-point change:** how well the system reacts to bring the controlled variable to a new set-point.
- **Transient Response:** if a sudden change happens in any of the process variables, the controlled variable changes also. The control system should work to minimize this effect.
