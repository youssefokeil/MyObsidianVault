- In 1896, the Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius recognized that burning coal could increase carbon dioxide and warm the climate. In a lecture, he described that it is not yet possible to calculate how fast temperature was rising. He thought that this might be a good thing, because people can live in less barren surroundings.

- In 1938, British coal engineer George Callendar compiled all carbon dioxide measurements made over the previous 100 years and found that the amount of CO2Â was increasing. He also found that temperatures were rising. But he thought that this  could be a good thing, because the return of ice age will never happen.

- In 1957, Hans Seuss an Austrian-born chemist that CO2 from industrial sources must be building up in the atmosphere, writing: "Thus human beings are now carrying out a large scale geophysical experiment of a kind that could not have happened in the past nor be reproduced in the future."

- In 1988, James Hansen testified before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee stating that climate was warming, greenhouse gases are responsible for the warming, and we are responsible for the growth in these gases.
