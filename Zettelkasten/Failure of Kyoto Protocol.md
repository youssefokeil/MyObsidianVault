# Failure of Kyoto Protocol
> The Kyoto Protocol has failed to stem global emissions. By 2012, global emissions have risen to 44% from 1997 levels.

### Reason:
 1. The protocol binds only countries that were historically responsible for climate change
	- By 2006, China surpassed the US in annual emissions.
	- India's emissions are equal to that of the EU
2. Countries view the protocol as an economic punishment. 
	- Led to the world's largest emitter, the US, to not ratify the protocol.
	- Paved the way for Canada and Japan to withdraw from the protocol in 2011. 

It's hard to say that the Kyoto Protocol failed because its goal was to decrease emissions by developed countries and lay the legal work for future amendments and more commitments to emission reduction.
