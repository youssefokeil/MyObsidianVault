## Usability Tests
1. Research
	 Ask people::
		 1. Give them a general overview of your application "it scans books & annotates them"
		 2. Then describe a situation "if a book is unidentified, how should the program proceed"
		**If you ask a lot of people, you'll start to see some kind of consensus.**
2. Prototype & Test
	build a simple model of your UI & give people tasks to accomplish. 
		Ex: if task is scan book --> you may find people trying to drag & drop, so this indicates that you need to support this

## 50-Cent Usability Tests
The more, the merrier is a wrong instinct --> 5 or 6 people is enough.
You can do just 50 cent usability tests, where you grab the next person you see & ask them to think out loud.
