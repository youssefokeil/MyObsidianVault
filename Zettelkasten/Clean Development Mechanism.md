# Clean Development Mechanism
>Assist developing countries to develop in a sustainable way. Help developed countries in achieving compliance with their quantified emission limitation.
### Article 12 of Kyoto:
>... assist Parties not included in Annex I in achieving sustainable development and in contributing to the ultimate objective of the Convention, and to assist Parties included in Annex I in achieving compliance with their quantified emission limitation and reduction commitments under Article 3.

It shall assist in arranging funding for certified clean development projects and activities.
- Cover administrative expenses
- Assist developing country parties to meet costs of adaptation
### Basis:
If a country adopts a certified project that is used for clean development then:
1. Voluntary participation of each country (developing and developed).
2. Real, measurable and long-term benefits related to mitigation of climate change.
3. Reductions in emissions are additional to any that would occur in the absence of project. Since, project already creates energy then this energy should be on top of the energy created by not clean mechanisms. But it should help in _reducing_ emissions.
