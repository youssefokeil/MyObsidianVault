# Elements of Transformative Societal Change
To study transformative change by a specific technology we must define different ways it can be transformative:
1. Becoming a general-purpose technology (GPT), being applied in different sectors with ripple effects on other sectors.
2. Irreversible effect on a specific domain (Ex: Nuclear Energy and Nuclear Power).
3. Unprecedented and fundamental societal change.4
What is common of all transformative change is that they can lead to [[Practically Irreversible Change]].
