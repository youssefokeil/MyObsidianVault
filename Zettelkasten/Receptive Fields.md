# Receptive Fields
Is the area involved in the calculation of a layer in Convolutions. More generally, it's the area of input data that a neuron is sensitive to. 

In CNNs, as you go deeper in a network the receptive field gets bigger. This is what makes CNNs so good in image processing as it's designed in hierarchal fashion to gradually learn more global features, beginning with edges and gradients to curves and complex features.
