# Checklist For My Case Study
I try to make reply to the answers that are the checklist for a good case study. Demonstrated in [[Case Study#Checklist What Makes a Good Case?]] [[Case Study|]]

1. The lessons learnt is the mishappens of ex-ante agreements. Why windfall clause may fail to deliver the expected outcomes. The issue is how kyoto protocol failed to make substantial change towards climate change.
2. The case study offers an overarching lesson from ex-ante agreements and why they don't work well under a capitalist regime. Especially when it forces the major players of the world economy and the most powerful stakeholders to do substantial change that will affect their company and power.
3. The case is a best example of a common problem in regulation which is how to force/motivate companies to accept ex-ante agreements and actually act upon them and not use lobbying and loopholes in the system to run away from the agreement.
4. It is a one that shows a path through difficult tradeoffs. Because we can all agree that making a world where people are starved to death and others are having enormous amount of wealth isn't one that we'll like to live in. Even the extremely rich won't want society to collapse and them to only live in their mansions with no one to interact with.
5. _rest to follow after I read windfall and kyoto._
