# Factored Representation
A factored representation splits up each state into a fixed set of
variables or attributes, each of which can have a value.

Two different [[Atomic Representation]] states can have nothing in common, while different factored representation states can have some in common.

Many important areas of AI are based on factored representations, including
constraint satisfaction algorithms, propositional logic, planning, Bayesian networks, and the machine learning algorithms.
