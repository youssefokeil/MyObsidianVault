# Organizational Structure of Project Management
There are 3 basic organization structures:
1. **Functional:** 
	- company is divided into departments or "functions"; Engineering, Manufacturing, IT, etc.
	- Functional managers have most of the power
	- *employees/staff* report to --> *functional managers* who report to --> *CEO*

2. **Project**
	- companies is structured around "projects" rather than functions
	- Project managers have high to total authority
	- *employees/staff* report to --> *project managers* who report to --> *CEO*

3. **Matrix**
	- hybrid approach which combines functional and projectized structures
	- *employees/staff* report to --> *project managers & functional managers* who report to --> *CEO*
	- Variations:
		- **Weak Matrix:** Functional managers retain most authority; similar to functional structure
		- **Balanced Matrix:** Authority is shared more equally between functional and project managers
		- **Strong Matrix:** Project managers have more authority; closer to projectized structure
