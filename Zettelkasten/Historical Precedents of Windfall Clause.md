# Historical Precedents of Windfall Clause
### Overall Cost of Windfall (Illustrative)
>Assume company will makes profit of $5(1.8%) trillion in 2060, when the GWP is $268 trillion, using [[Windfall Function]] 
1. 0% of its first $268 billion in profits, for a subtotal of $0; 
2. 1% of its next $2.412 trillion in profits, for a subtotal of $24.12 billion; and 
3. 20% of its next $2.32 trillion in profits, for a subtotal of $464 billion
- Assumptions:
	1. Discount 10% annually (cost of capital of internet firms)
	2. Owing $488.12 billion indefinitely
	3. 1% chance that a company will reach windfall profits

$$\sum\limits_{t=(2060–2019)}^{\infty} {$488.12 * 10^9 * (1 – 0.1)^t}=$64.934 $$
$$(0.01)*$64.934\text{ billion}=$649\text{ million}$$
### 1. 5 percent club:
> In the 1960s to 1970s, leading US firms donated 5% of their pre-tax earnings to charities.

Although collaborations among competitors can trigger antitrust scrutiny.
### 2. Prosocial behaviors
>Firms entering social responsibility efforts. They benefit greatly because of certification marks on products.
- Rainforest Alliance
- Fair Trade
- Forest Stewardship Council
### 3. OpenAI "capped-profit" model
>Allow company to raise capital necessary to build powerful AI systems and also maintain their philanthropic mission.
### 4. Sovereign Wealth Funds
>manage windfalls for benefit of present and future citizens. $1 trillion for Norwegian Government Pension Fund which is aimed to preserve (developed countries ) or development of developing countries.

**Justification:**
as a financial reserve and as a long-term savings plan so that both current and future generations get to benefit from our (current) oil wealth.
### 5. Giving Pledge:
>Bill and Melinda Gates and their foundation epitomize—and indeed helped shape—this norm. They and Warren Buffett launched the Giving Pledge: a nonbinding commitment by billionaires to donate more than half of their wealth
