# Pick up what they put down
>Definition: Pick up new stuff professionals (or people that just know a bit more than you) make. New stuff could be, libraries, tutorials, books, course.
### Why?
- The internet lack genuine feedback, especially new stuff. By giving them your feedback, they'll most probably share your review or retweet it all day long.
### How?
- If it's a new **book**, review it in a blog or make a twitter thread and summarize it in your own words.
- If it's a new **library**, try it out and comment on confusing documentation or things that don't work.
- Try their new **demos** and comment on the issues.
