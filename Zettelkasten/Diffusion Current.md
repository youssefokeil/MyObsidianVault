# Diffusion Current

Current that happens in electrolytes, metals but is typically mentioned in the contexts of semi-conductors. Due to motion of electrons and holes from high concentration to low concentration, obeying Fick's law.
$$\Large J_{p-diff}=-qD_{p}\frac{dp}{dx}$$
$$\Large J_{n-diff}=+qD_{n}\frac{dn}{dx}$$
- Where D is diffusion coefficient
- Useful in the contexts of injection from one side and changing the density at a specific part in the material.
