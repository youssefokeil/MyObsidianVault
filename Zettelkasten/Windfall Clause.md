# Windfall Clause
>Is an [[Ex-Ante Agreement]]. By voluntarily adopting the Windfall Clause, firms would bindingly agree to donate a meaningful portion of their profits if they earn a historically unprecedented economic windfall from the development of advanced AI. We define a “windfall” as a level of income greater than a substantial fraction (e.g., at least 1%) of the world’s total economic output.

**NB:**
- To understand how much money a signatory to the Clause owes as a function of profit, lookup [[Windfall Function]]
- Also lookup, [[Ethical Motivation for Windfall Clause]].
- And for the companies' incentive, lookup [[Firm Motivation for Windfall Clause]]
### Criticism:
- A core challenge when trying to design a windfall clause is that there is an incredibly strong incentive to find a loophole once the clause takes effect. If you run an organization who signed a windfall clause and in the future the unlikely comes to pass and you actually end up making $11 trillion in annual profits, it would be rational for you to spend up to $10 trillion on legal fees to try to get out of that clause just for that year; preferably in a way that doesn't cost you too much credibility. Companies are doing this already–this is why the big internet companies pay hardly any taxes.
