# Classification of Software Systems

### Casual Systems (Type C)
- Not under high pressure for high-quality performance
- Can tolerate minor bugs
- Ex:
	- data migration program
	- academic project 
- Do not require high internal quality standards or sophistication.
- Are subject to the problem of [[over-engineering]], as there's no need for advanced techniques.
- They do not benefit from SW engineering practices as they are usually implemented by a singled developer
### Business Systems (Type B)
- benefit the most out of the SW engineering principles
- Ex
	- compilers and IDEs
	- software libraries and frameworks
	- text-editors and spreadsheets
	- finance and human resources
- Has to have good internal and external quality.
### Acute Systems (Type A)
- A single failure may have devastating consequences, including loss of human lives.
- Ex:
	- Control Systems used in autonomous vehicles.
	- nuclear power plants
- Requires rigorous processes, including code reviews and external certification
- Sometimes they are designed using formal languages based on  set theory and logic.
