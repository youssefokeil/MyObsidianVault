# Exploration-Exploitation trade-off
> exploration is the act of exploring the environment, while exploitation is the act of exploiting known information to maximize the reward.

To obtain a lot of reward the reinforcement learning agent must prefer actions that it has tried in the past and found to be effective. This however means that the agent, must've explore for a while to find those actions. And to make better actions in the future, the agent must continue exploring and find better action selections. 

In a stochastic task, the agent must have tried many times to gain a reliable estimate of the expected reward.
### Racing Example;
You're playing Need For Speed, your agent has tried a route that has an expected position of the third in the game. 
- The agent now has two opportunities, one is to **explore** the environment for shortcuts  which has the risk of achieving a bad position but the probable opportunity of being the first in the game
- or to just **exploit** known information and take the risk of missing a better route.
