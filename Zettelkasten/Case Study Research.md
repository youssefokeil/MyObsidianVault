# Case Study Research
Case study is an in-depth exploration from multiple perspectives of the complexity and uniqueness of a particular project, policy, institution or system in a “real-life” context. It is research based, inclusive of different methods and is evidence-led

### Methodology:
It is not defined by one method or perspective. 
- You can conduct a case study using primarily _quantitative data.
- Or you can use _qualitative data._
- Now we overcome the partisan focus of either quantitative or qualitative data. Mixed methods are now used.
