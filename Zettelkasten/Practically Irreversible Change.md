# Practically Irreversible Change
Has long-lasting effects and is extremely costly to revoke and destroys a thing that has no functional equivalent.
- Â Technologies may have practically irreversible societal impacts by enabling new products and capabilities that are so embedded in society our lives become dependent on them. 
	- Ex: Electricity can be said to be truly irreversible as eliminating it can lead to catastrophic loss of life. 
- Technologies that are "lock-in" of trajectories. A technology can be used so much in a certain application, that it can be extremely difficult to change.
	- Ex: QWERTY keyboard, is the most used keyboard for 140 years. Although it is suboptimal, a lot of technologies depend on it that it's "locked-in".
