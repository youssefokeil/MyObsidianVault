# Supervised Learning
> derives patterns from well organized data, usually provided by humans.

### Training:
- The Algorithm is given the features and the label
- The algorithm the learns to make the best model to predict the labels
### Inference:
- The algorithm is called on features without labels and is asked to make a prediction about the label

### Cons:
- Depends on having the data structured in a way that it has the "right answer".

### Uses
1. In 2017, US invested in Project Maven:
	1. apply supervised learning to photos and videos collected by drones
	2. Predict equipment failures in helicopters
