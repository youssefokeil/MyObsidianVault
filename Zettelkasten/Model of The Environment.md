# Model of The Environment
> mimics the behavior of the environment, which allows inferences to be made about how the environment will behave. Meaning that it can predict the next reward and state, given the current action and state. 

This is used in what we call *planning*, defined as deciding on a course by considering possible future situations before they are actually experienced.

Models are used in [[Model-Based Methods]] that use models and planning.
