### Version Control
- version control systems such as Git, store all versions of a software project including source code, documentation and web pages.
- They enable restoration of a specific previous version if a change introduces a bug.

### Semantic Versioning
To handle system versions, teams use the _x.y.z_ format to identify the versions of a library they're working on. x, y, z are all integers. 
- change in x, means a major launch and substantial new features
- change in y means a small update
- change in z means a patch release that fixes bugs
