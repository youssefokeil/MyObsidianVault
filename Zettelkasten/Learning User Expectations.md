# Learning User Expectations
**User Model**: user's idea of what's happening
**Program Model:** program's idea of what's happening

## Why?
- The User always come with a set of expectations on how they think the program is going to work.
- If the *user model* conflicts with the program model; it's easier to change the *program model*:
	- Changing the *user model*, demands that we let the user reads manuals --> will probably not be read by users.
	- Or making pop-up dialog boxes --> irritates sophisticated users & users don't read dialog boxes.
	Ex: copying an image in a word document, makes it embedded meaning that if you delete the file, it will still be shown in your document. This is different from markdown & html where you need to specify the path of the file. 
	---> This is a conflict between the user and the program model.
	---> Can be solved by saving the copied image file into  a sub-directory near the HTML file.
