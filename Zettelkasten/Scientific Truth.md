# Scientific Truth
> can't be confirmed by experiments. Only scientific falsehood can be demonstrated using experiments, when an experiment fails to behave as expected. But no amount of experiments can predict that the next experiment will fail. That's why scientists speak of theories not truths. 

## Discarded Scientific Theories:
- Static universe theory. 
	The theory that the universe doesn't expand nor contract & space and time are both infinite was a very famous scientific theory proposed by Thomas Digges (1546-1595). Einstein preferred this model but said that space is finite.
	- This was later disproved by Edwin Hubble after the redshift discovery.
- The existence of [[Luminiferous Aether]] that carries the light through the [[Michelson-Morley experiment]]. It was also our gateway towards the _Theory of Relativity_.
