# Legal Permissibility
- We study the corporate law of state of Delaware, since plurality of major American corporations are incorporated there. Due to, its business-friendly tax, legal and regulation policies.
- Focus on for-profit corporations.
### In the US (particularly Delaware):
**Corporate Philanthropy under BJR:**
>Corporate expenditures are judged by the [[Business Judgement Rule (BJR)]]. The expenditure isn't invalidated when the benefit is intangible, noneconomic or uncertain. 

- For the above reason, directors may use the card that generating goodwill was the reasoning behind giving to charity in Delaware courts.
- The donation must be reasonable. For that courts use the [[Internal Revenue Code (IRC)]].
- If a manager is also employed in a nonprofit organization lacks independence from that organization. So he may not be protected by the BJR.

**Windfall Clause:**
It can be challenged under the case that it exceeds the threshold put by the internal revenue code.
- It should be assessed using the _expected value_, this primarily depends on the small probability that windfall profits will happen. We can evaluate windfall clause and stock option compensation, as both are ex-ante.
$$\text{expected value}=P(\text{event triggered})*Cost$$
### In China: 
**Corporate Philanthropy Law:**
Unlike Delaware Law, Chinese corporate law actively encourages some degree of corporate philanthropy.
>â€œobserve social morality and business ethics, act in good faith, accept supervision by the government and the public, and bear social responsibilities."
>									_Article 5 of China's Company Law_

- China's new charity law deducts taxes on corporate donations
- Corporations receive extra points towards local CSR certification.
