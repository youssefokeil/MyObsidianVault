# Interrupts
> interrupts are automatic transfer to software executions in response to a hardware event that is asynchronous with the current software being executed

__Can be Software/Hardware:
- Periodic interrupts, from hardware timers. Like Systick Timers (if you enable INTEN (bit 1))
- Input/Output operation. New data input or idle in output
- Software programmed to fire an interrupt
