# Learn in Public
>Definition: Sharing your work and projects online or with a community throughout your learning journey.

### Why?
- You'll never stop learning and probably never think you're good enough. So why not make something meaningful while you learn? 
- Teaching is the best way to learn.
### How?
1. Speak at meetups and conferences
2. Write blogs, tutorials & cheatsheets.
3. Ask & answer on StackOverflow/Reddit (avoid something gated as Discord & Slack).
4. Make YouTube videos of your projects, make online tutorials.
5. Draw cartoons explaining concepts.
6. Clone projects you like to learn how it works.
7. Replicate a research paper by coding it and share it on GitHub.
8. Teach workshops (can be in your University).
9. Make libraries even if no one will use it.
10. Go to conferences & summarize what you learnt on your blog.
11. Reach out to professionals and try to let them be your mentors:
	- **[[Pick up what they put down]]**(especially if it's new). Any new course/papers, tell them your ideas/review.
	- If any professional needs _**help**_, offer it and they'll help you in return one way or another.
	- Reach out to the coding video/book author and thank them/ ask them. (Avoid that if the video/author is popular and try [[Permissionless Apprenticeship]] instead)
### Tips:
- Don't judge your content with views or retweets.
- _Try your best to be right, don't worry if you're wrong_ because the internet will correct you.
- Make an almost daily-developer blog on things you wished you learnt 3 months ago.%
- Speak to your expertise
- Speak to your experience and things you wish you've learnt
- 99% of the time you won't get any feedback.
- Delete the work whenever you feel like it.
