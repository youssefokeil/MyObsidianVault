# Thevenin Equivalence
- Any two terminals can be replaced by a voltage source and a series impedance.
- Developed independently by German scientist Hermann von Helmholtz in 1853 and 1883 by French scientist Leon Charles Thevenin. Was called "Helmholtz's Theory" in other countries.

### Steps:
1. Disconnect all independent sources and the equivalent impedance between the two terminals is Thevenin Impedance.

2. Measure the open circuit voltage between the two terminals and it's equal the Thevenin Voltage.
