# Cybernetics
> study of circular processes, such as feedback and recursion. Where the effects of a system influences subsequent action, as they return back as inputs. It can also be interpreted as a [[dialectic]] between the machine and the human.
> Ex: Autonomous systems and machines that can self-regulate.

## Central Ideas:
1. **Feedback**
	the central idea of cybernetics is feedback this can be seen in [[Control Systems]]. Feedback is when the system's output are fed as inputs for further actions.
	*Positive Feedback*, is when feedback the processes increase the difference from the desired state.
	*Negative Feedback*, is when feedback decreases the difference from a desired state.
2. **Autopeiesis**


## Cybernetic Music
Roland Kayn is a German composer of electronic music, he was influenced by information theorists. 

His ideas were that "cybernetic" music should regulate itself, relinquishing narrative elements and psycho-emotional details. He could not predict the eventual composition.
## History
### First Wave
The initial focus are parallels between regulatory feedback in biological and technological systems. 

In the **US**, cybernetics developed through a series of trans-disciplinary conferences, between 1946 and 1953. 

In the **UK**, similar focus by young psychiatrists, psychologists, mathematicians and physiologists. Between 1949 and 1958. Norbert Wiener introduced the idea of "teleological mechanisms" through the book _[Cybernetics: Or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics:_Or_Control_and_Communication_in_the_Animal_and_the_Machine "Cybernetics: Or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine")_.

In 1960s and 1970s, the cybernetics' transdisciplinarity fragmented as AI and computer science became distinct academic disciplines.

### Second Wave
The second wave had its focus inflecting away from technology and to social, philosophical and ecological concerns. 

Focuses included, management cybernetics like Stafford Beer's [[viable system model]], [[epistemology]] and [[pedagogy]], among others.

### Third Wave
 In the 1990s, a renewed interest in cybernetics. It led to exchanges about [[feminist technoscience]] and [[posthumanism]]. 

Re-examinations of cybernetics' history have been science studies scholars emphasising its unusual qualities as a science, such as its "[[performative ontology]]".
