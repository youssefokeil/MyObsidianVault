# Tailwind CSS
- Styling with a functional approach using Utility Class
	- Variants like small `sm:`, medium and large `lg:` to handle resizing
	- Dark `dark:` to handle dark mode
	- hover `hover:` and focus to handle state changes
- As UI grows in complexity, code duplication happens, but you can use the `@apply` directive
- Tooling on VS code, it autocompletes every tailwind class or configure your own design system.
- To optimize performance they produce minimal dead code and only upload used classes.
