## ML Roadmap Industrial
- Learn stable models, this will be your core work.
- You have to look from time to time for research papers in your field, whether that was NLP or Computer Vision.
- Look up current trends like: RAG, AI Agents.
- Lookup: UC Berkeley's Full Stack Deep Learning.
### NLP
- It works in industry more, because of the low resources of research labs.
---------
## ML Roadmap Research
- You don't have to learn all of the ML frameworks.
- You have to [[Read research]] and be really good at it.
- Learn classical ML approaches; supervised, unsupervised & semi-supervised learning.
- Watch Andrew Ng's Course CS229, CS230
- Get good GPA.
### Learn the Math behind Classical Models
- Mathematics For Machine Learning: not enough but will get you going.
- Linear Algebra: [[Elementary Linear Algebra]] (Gilbert Strang's YouTube Playlist)
- Probability: [[A First Course in Probability]]
- Vector Calculus: [[Calculus by Stewart]], [[Calculus by Michael Spivak]]
### NLP
- booming because of LLMs
- use model to train another model (I think he's talking about [[RLAIF; Reinforcement Learning with AI Feedback]])
### Computer Vision
- detection; the problem is kind of solved because of YOLO models, but YOLO models aren't enough because of out of domain detection.
- Task-specific problems, not mainstream and the task is very specific.
