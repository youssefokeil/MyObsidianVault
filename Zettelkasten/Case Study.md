# Case Study
- Major approach to research and evaluation.
- Documents a particular situation in a specific sociopolitical context.
- For a study to count as research, it has to generate evidence that leads to _new_ knowledge. Open to scrutiny.

[[Examples of Case Studies]].

## Checklist: What Makes a Good Case?
1) What, broadly, are the lessons learned from this case and what types of information apply to the motivating problem or questions? What central issue does the case raise? How is the issue relevant to your problem or projected solution? Can those issues be raised equally well or better by another case? 
2) Does the case study offer a theory or overarching lesson? Does the case serve strategic as well as substantive goals? 
3) Is the case the best example of a common problem? Alternatively, does it offer the best example of a strong solution to a common problem? If the case is an isolated instance of the problem, you’ll want to set it aside in favor of stronger evidence. If a case is unique, it may not be useful in demonstrating an overarching problem. On the other hand, the solution to a general problem is, in fact, the thing you’ll highlight as a unique strategy with application to other instances. 
4) Is the case about something fundamentally controversial or one that shows a path through difficult tradeoffs? Does the case offer solutions to tough problems? Alternatively, does it show a failure to address such problems? 
5) Where are the decision points in the case? Excavate the points of controversy and highlight the decisions that ensued. Sort out the relevant options for each problem area in the case. What problems in each option must the central players resolve? How do those decision points fit in the context of your motivating question/s? 
6) Does the case address principles of management or particular methods of analysis? 
7) Have you carefully explained central lessons? Idiosyncratic facts can impede progress. Too many facts keep the focus on the particulars. Briefly glean the central lessons for your reader or decision-maker. 
8) Offer a conclusion to each case study that highlights lessons learned, applying those lessons specifically to the themes at stake in your own problem or projected solutions. Make it easy for your decision maker to understand the key lessons from the case. 
9) Develop a set of findings or lessons learned, supported by your analysis, of the case data. 
10) Do you have supporting data that points to best practices that you can build into your recommendations? If so, synthesizing those practices for immediate action steps for your decision maker and in the context of your research goals. Note: Best Practices require careful, replicable analysis.
