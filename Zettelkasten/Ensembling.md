# Ensembling
is a brilliant approach in machine learning, where it combines the predictions of a couple of different models and the ensemble will have better results than any model on its' own.
### Tips for Ensembling:
1. Before Ensembling check if the errors are correlated. If they aren't, ensemble.
2. The errors of different models cancel out and approach the absolute truth. Just like how Wikipedia edits work.
3. Use [[cross-validation]].
