# Putting Ideas Into Words
- Once you publish, the convention is that whatever you wrote was what you thought before you wrote it. 
	- This isn't true as putting your ideas into words changed them.
- Read what you've written as if you're a neutral reader who knows nothing of what's in your head
- It's possible to form complete ideas in your head.
