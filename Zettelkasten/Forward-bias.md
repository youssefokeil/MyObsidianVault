- The applied voltage opposes the barrier voltage.
- Depletion width decreases. Increasing Capacitance.
- Diffusion current exponentially increases.
- Net current becomes nearly an exponential function with the applied voltage V:- ![[I-V Characteristics of PN Junction#I-V Characteristics of PN Junction]]
