- Depletion width increases decreasing Capacitance.
- Applied voltage increases voltage barrier and decreases diffusion current.
- Electric field increases.
- But drift current stays as it is because there are no carriers to move.
- Net current is so small (called reverse saturation current)$$I\approx I_{S}$$
- At very high reverse-bias, diode breakdown happens. Leading to very high reverse current  (Review the I_V Characteristics) ![[I-V Characteristics of PN Junction#I-V Characteristics of PN Junction]]
