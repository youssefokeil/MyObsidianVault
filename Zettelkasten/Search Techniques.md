### Uninformed Search Techniques
also called **blind search**, the term means that strategies have no additional information about states beyond the problem definition.

All they can do is generate successors and distinguish a goal state. The **blind/uninformed search** don't know whether a non-goal state is *more promising* than the other. 

**Examples:**
1. [[Breadth-First Search]]
2. [[Depth-First Search]]
