### Amendments to PFs
The field of AI-related risks and evals is new. We expect that most risks happening in the future are not conceived by us yet. We must ensure that Frontier AI companies will update their preparedness frameworks accordingly.


### Anthropic
- Anthropic labels is RSP as "Version 1.0" to acknowledge the need for updates.
- They included a whole section called "Update Process". "We expect most updates to this process to be incremental…as we learn more about model safety features or unexpected capabilities…”.


### OpenAI
- Their "PF" is labeled as "(Beta)" to acknowledge the importance of regular updates.
- They mention updates of their scorecard. “The Scorecard will be regularly updated by the Preparedness team to help ensure it reflects the latest research and findings”
