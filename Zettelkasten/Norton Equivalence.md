# Norton Equivalence
- Derived in 1926, independently by Hans Ferdinand Mayer and Edward Lowry Norton
- Turning everything between two terminals to an equivalent current source and parallel impedance.

### Steps:
1. Turn off all independent sources. The Norton equivalent impedance Zn=Zeq equivalent impedene=ce between the two terminals.

2. Make a short circuit between the two terminals. The Norton equivalent I = I s.c.
