# Control Element
>The final element in the process-control operation. It works by taking a signal from the [[Controller]] as input then transforms it into a proportional operation that manipulates the process till our controlled variable reaches the set-point. Before the control element, there's often an actuator that turns the electric signal of the controller to _actuate_ the final control element.
