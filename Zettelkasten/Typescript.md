### Static Typing
Static typing refers to when variables are explicitly declared with their data types (like integer, string, boolean) at compile time, and the system performs type checking before the program runs.

```
let name: string="Youssef";
	name =2000 //causes an error
```
the second line wouldn't cause an error in JavaScript but it will in TypeScript, which eases debugging
