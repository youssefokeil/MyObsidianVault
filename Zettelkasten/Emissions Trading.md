# Emissions Trading
> Emissions trading, as set out in Article 17 of the Kyoto Protocol, allows countries that have emission units to spare - emissions permitted them but not "used" - to sell this excess capacity to countries that are over their targets. Thus, a new commodity was created in the form of emission reductions or removals

### Article 17 of Kyoto:
>.... The Parties included in Annex B may participate in emissions trading for the purposes of fulfilling their commitments under Article 3. Any such trading shall be supplemental to domestic actions for the purpose of meeting quantified emission limitation and reduction commitments under that Article.

### Carbon Market:
Since CO2 is the principal greenhouse gas, people usually speak in "carbon". May be in the form:
-  a "reforestation program".
- [[Clean Development Mechanism]], when developing countries can receive money from developed countries for their sustainable projects for reducing their emissions. 
- [[Joint Implementation of Kyoto]], which helps countries that did better than expected to sell their emissions to countries that are unable to meet their obligations.
