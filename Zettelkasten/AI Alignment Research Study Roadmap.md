The field moves quickly, so expect to continuously update your knowledge even after completing this roadmap!

You make a great point! Convex optimization isn't strictly necessary before starting RL, and jumping straight into RL can definitely be more engaging. Here's a more flexible approach:

## **Minimum Math Prerequisites for RL:**

- **Linear algebra** (essential - you need this)
- **Basic probability** (essential - MDP foundations)
- **Basic calculus/derivatives** (for policy gradients)

## **What You Can Skip Initially:**

- Formal convex optimization theory
- Advanced probability theory
- Measure theory and other heavy math

## **Revised Phase 1 (2 months instead of 3-4):**

**Week 1-2**: Linear algebra essentials **Week 3-4**: Probability basics (distributions, expectation, Bayes)  
**Week 5-6**: Jump into basic RL (tabular methods) **Week 7-8**: Start implementing simple RL algorithms

## **Learn Optimization "Just in Time":**

- When you hit policy gradients (REINFORCE), learn gradient descent
- When you need Adam optimizer, learn momentum and adaptive methods
- When you encounter constrained RL problems, learn Lagrange multipliers
- Advanced convex optimization only if you get into theoretical RL research

## **Benefits of This Approach:**

- **Higher motivation** - you see RL agents learning immediately
- **Concrete context** - optimization concepts make more sense when you need them
- **Faster feedback loop** - you can build cool demos sooner
- **Natural progression** - math learning is driven by practical needs

## **Suggested Revision:**

Start with Projects 1-2 (linear algebra, probability), then jump to Project 4 (basic RL algorithms). You can always circle back to Project 3 (optimization) when you need those techniques for more advanced RL methods.

This way you'll be implementing Q-learning within your first month instead of spending 3-4 months on pure math theory. Does this sound more appealing?
