# No Silver Bullet
- Written by Frederick Brooks.
- In the field there are two types of problems, essential difficulties and accidental difficulties.
- Essential difficulties are intrinsic to the field and are unlikely to be solved., due to the essential difficulties we should not anticipate the existence of silver bullets.

#### Examples of Essential Difficulties:
1. Complexity: Of all human-made constructions software stands as one of the most intricate and complex.
2. Conformity: Software must adapt continuously to the ever-changing  environment.
	if environmental laws change, car manufacturers have years to comply with the new legislation.
3. Changeability: Constant pressure for software to evolve and incorporate new features.
	Cars, once manufactured do not usually receive new functionalities.
4. Invisibility: It's inherently challenging to visualize the structure and complexity of software due to its abstract nature.
	A car's physical properties such as weight, shape facilitate evaluation by customers.
