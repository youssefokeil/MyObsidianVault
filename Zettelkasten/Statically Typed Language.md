# Statically Typed Language
- All variables, parameters and methods must have a declared type. After declaration, the type can't change. Ex: `int x=0;`

### Advantages:
- Type errors never happen for end users, because end users get the compiled file which is checked for type errors.
- Less debugging on developer side.
- Avoids runtime type checking
- Easier to reason about code.
### Disadvantages:
- More verbosity for code
- Code is less generalizable, as you can't use same variable twice.
