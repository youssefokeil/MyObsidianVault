# Do small tweaks daily
### Tips: 
- Try different architectures and cover as much ground as possible.
- Focus later on [[hyperparameters]].
- Know your data and see what typically works (Ex: for tabular data, try random forests).
- Make a [[baseline]] as simple as it can be. Do experiments and see of you're going to the right direction
- Shine the light on the part in the pipeline that you think will benefit the most from tweaking.
- Take a subset of your data and run your pipeline regularly.
>Remember to move in small steps, so when your model has a problem you can localize it to the few lines of code you've written.
