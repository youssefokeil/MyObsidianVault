# Silicon Si
Silicon is a semi-conductor with 4 valence electrons and 14 atomic number. The valence electrons are held by covalent bonds and at 0K there's no free electrons. At room temperature, the covalent bonds are broken around 10^10 free electrons and the same amount of holes making them available for current conduction.

### Uses of Silicon:
- Used in most devices that use semi-conductors, because it's cheap relative to the rest and abundantly available.
- Used in alloys like ferro-silicon alloy,
