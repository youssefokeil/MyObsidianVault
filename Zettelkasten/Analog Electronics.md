### Why Analog Electronics:
- We send wireless data with analog signals. Because Electromagnetic waves are analog signals.
- All physical signals (sound, light, temperature) are analog and we'll always need an interface between physical world & our digital electronics
### Analog Signal Issues:
 - Susceptible to noise.
 - Analog Electronics design isn't automated and is still drawn by hand. 
 - Hard to store and process.
