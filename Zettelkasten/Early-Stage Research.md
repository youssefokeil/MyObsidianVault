# The Lean Startup Approach
>you should think of yourself as an entrepreneur trying to build products (i.e. research outputs) that customers (i.e. the broader community) want to consume.

### Lean Startup:
- Most ideas are bad and founders should embrace this.
- So they test minimal versions of the product to get feedback from customers
### 1) Get Better Ideas
- Write out at least 10 project ideas and ask somebody more senior to rank the best few.
- If somebody is genuinely interested, you'll notice you'll get a cue that a person i actually interested
- Read existing literature and think can I add anything to this?
- Your comparative advantage is hat you have more time on your hands and more enthusiasm for doing donkey work.
### 2) Make People care
- find an elegant way to describe the problem, they want something slick.
- focus on a narrow problem
- focus on the title, abstract and the introduction
- Re-draft and draft
- Your writing style should help the reader
- Market your work
