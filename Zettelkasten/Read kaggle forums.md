# Read kaggle forums

> Simply following Kaggle forums will take you 80% of the way toward a good solution.
\- Radek Osmulski, Metalearning

### Why read forums
- If you're struggling, reading them combined with notebooks will get you going.
- The ability to discuss what you are seeing with others is a great source of inspiration.
- It's very effective.
- A great resource to learn new methodologies.
### After forums
- You'll have to do some digging on your own. Top kagglers aren't obliged to share everything with you.
- You'll have to some follow-up and tweaks to your model, do not just read the forum.
