# Why STMicroelectronics?
1. Has a very good **Edge AI Suite.** It's a very comprehensive set of software tools, which offers developers like us a simple and cost-effective way for developers to embed AI-enabled ST products. This will make our deployment and embedding phase so much simpler.
2.  Has a large portfolio of hardware products and software development tools. On the MLPerf Tiny Benchmark, 73% of solutions were based on STM32.
3. ST is a very reputable company working on everything from working on AI in washing machines, to the maintenance of EV motors. We think ST can transfer a bit of this experience so that our solution can be actually market-ready. It has deep links and trust within the industry and can help us a lot to deploy our solution in the market.
4. ST is already working on Edge AI with computer vision, their website shows a lot of projects than use multi-pose detection and Advanced Human Presence Detection. In addition to a lot of demonstrations of real-time object-detection and tracking.
