# Baud Rate
> number of bits transferred per second. The inverse of baud rate is bit time.

- Standard baud rates: 4,800 | 9,600 | 57,600 | 115,200
- In interfacing you have to synchronize the transmitter and receiver, by dividing their baud rates.

__NB:__ not to be confused with bandwidth, which is the amount of useful information sent per second.
