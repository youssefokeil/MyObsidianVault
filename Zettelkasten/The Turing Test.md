# Acting Humanly: The Turing Test
A computer passes the test if a human interrogator, after posing some written questions, cannot tell whether the written responses come from a person or from a computer.

This needs:
- [[Natural Language Processing]], to communicate in language
- knowledge representation, to store information (maybe in the form of vector embeddings for example)
- automated reasoning. to use stored information and come up with new conclusions
- [[machine learning]], to adapt to new circumstances

The *Total Turing Test*, where the interrogator tests the perceptual abilities of the AI by showing video and passing objects to the AI, this needs in addition to the above:
- [[computer vision]],for perception.
- robotics, to manipulate and move objects.
