# Software Requirements
Requirements define both what a system should do and how it should behacve. Requirements are classified as either functional or non functional.

### Functional Requirements
- Define the features or services the system should provide
#### For a banking application example
- account display
- statement generation
- transfers between accounts
- debit card cancellation
### Non-Functional Requirements
- Outline _how_ a system should operate.
- Constraints and the quality of service.
#### For a banking application example
- Performance: The application must be able to provide an account balance within two seconds.
    
- Availability: The application must be online 99% of the time.
    
- Fault tolerance: The application must continue functioning even if a specific data center fails.
    
- Security: The application must encrypt all data exchanged with branches.
    
- Privacy: Customer data must be maintained as confidential and not be leaked to third parties.
    
- Interoperability: The application must integrate with Central Bank systems.
    
- Scalability: The application should be able to handle data for one million banking customers.
    
- Usability: The application must be accessible to visually impaired individuals.
