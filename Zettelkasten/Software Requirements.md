# Software Requirements
Requirements define both what a system should do and how it should behave. 
- It's a critical step as if the system is deployed well and designed well but fails to satisfy the customer needs, rework will be done that will have high costs.

__Requirements are classified as either functional or non functional.

![[Functional Requirements#Functional Requirements]]


![[Non-Functional Requirements#Non-Functional Requirements]]


Another classification is classifying requirements into [[User Requirements]] & [[System Requirements]].
