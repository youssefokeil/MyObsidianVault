## (Attempt for an) Explanation
The wheel takes a solid form, but the hole in the middle of the wheel is where the functional part is. The wheel can't move without that hole in the middle.

The pot is supposed to hold food/soup/water, the empty part  in the pot is where the food goes.

The Tao is trying to tell us to make our centers empty, let go of all desire so that we can be functional people. He may be saying that, unless you empty out your soul, you'll never be functional.

## Commentary: 

This can be look like double-think, because why would I want to be functional if there's no goal I am trying to achieve. But the Tao is having a different approach to life, one where  the point of your existence is to be flowing with nature. Guided throughout with what is happening in the present moment. The point may be not to change the world around you to achieve the abstract goal in your mind, but to accept whatever is happening around you and flow with it. Letting go of control and accepting that you have little control on the environment around you.
