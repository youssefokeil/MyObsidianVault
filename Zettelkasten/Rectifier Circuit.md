# Rectifier Circuit
> Rectifier is a device used to turn ac voltage to dc. 

## Operation:
The simplest rectifier is a _**half-wave rectifier**_. It consists of a diode and a resistor connected in series. Assuming ideal characteristics. 
- In positive half-cycles, the current will flow through the diode, thus, the output voltage will equal the input voltage. 
- During negative half-cycles, the diode will act as an open circuit and the output voltage is zero.
