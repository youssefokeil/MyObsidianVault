# Nonlinear Circuits
> A circuit whose parameters (capacitance, resistance, inductance, frequency) are changed with respect to Current and Voltage. 

## Examples:
- [[Diode]]
- [[Transistor]]
- Transformer, Inductor (when the core saturates)
## Advantages:
- Used in generation of dc voltages from ac power supply
- generations of waveform signals (ex : sinusoids, square waves, pulses)
- Logic and memory circuits are special class of nonlinear circuits
