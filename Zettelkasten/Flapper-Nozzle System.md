# Flapper-Nozzle System
![[Screenshot 2024-06-08 135612.png]]
It's an example of a [[pneumatic process]].
### Operation:
- I increases with proportion to the Voltage applied
- As I changes the magnetic force coming from solenoid changes
- depending on the positioning of the solenoid, it can be used to open or close the flapper. But, generally the solenoid moves the flapper
- As the flapper moves, some of the gas is liberated in air.
- As some of the gas is liberated, we can control the pressure of the system
