# Superposition Theorem (circuits)
- Applied for linear circuits
- Analogous to [[Dalton's Law]] for partial pressures
- Useful to split the circuit to AC and DC

### Steps
1. Deactivate all **independent** sources (leave dependent ones) and leave one
 2. For deactivation of Voltage sources put short circuit
 3. For current sources put an open circuit
 4. Calculate the physical property whatever it was name it V' or I'
 5. repeat 2,3,4 till you calculate your physical property using each independent source and add them together. $$I=I'+I''+..$$$$V=V'+V''+...$$
