# Drift Current
Is the current induced due to particles being pulled by an electric field. It happens in metals, electrolytes but is typically used within the context of semi-conductors. 
- Caused by electric field
- Direction of current is in the same direction of the field for both electrons and holes.
- Small compared to the diffusion current in the P-N Junction.
- There will be no current, if there's no carriers even if there's an electric field.
- Drift velocity of both holes(p) and electrons(n):
$$\Large\upsilon_{p-drift}=\mu_{p}*\xi$$
$$\Large\upsilon_{n-drift}=-\mu_{n}*\xi$$
- Formula is derived from the ohm's law
- Drift for holes typically happens in valence band
- Drift for electrons typically happens in conduction band
- Mobility of electrons is 2-4 times the mobility of holes
- as electrons move in conduction band which is more free than the valence band so they have smaller effective mass

**Remember:**
$$\Large\mu_{n}=[{\displaystyle {\frac {e\tau_{c}}{m_{e}^{*}}}}]$$
m*=effective mass, $$\tau_{c}$$ is mean free time, e = charge of electron
