### History:
- Originated in the 1970s as software engineering began to gain recognition.
- took inspiration from traditional engineering processes
- US department of defense standardized it in 1985, meaning that all software contracted by the DoD had to be implemented using Waterfall.
### Criticism:
- In the late 1990s, due to project delays and cost overruns the Waterfall model received major criticism. 
- Users may have to wait for years to see a piece of software running, because of the need of a full requirements gathering phase and a complete design phase.
- By the time the software starts running, the world may not need the system specified years before.
