# System Testing
> Evaluates the end-to-end system specifications and validates the fully integrated software product.
- tests how components interact with each other and the whole system
- verifies every input and output for desired results
- focuses on **user experience** and overall functionality
- falls under [[Black-Box Testing]] we test from the outside without looking at source code.
-----
## Pros:
- even if components work individually and are well-integrated, they may fail from an end-user perspective.
