# Software Maintenance
>like traditional engineering, software needs maintenance.

### Types of Maintenance:
1. __Corrective__
	aims to address bugs by reported by users or other developers.
2. __Preventive__
	- addressing latent bugs that haven't yet caused failures observed by users.
	- Ex: Before the turn of the millennium, many organizations used two digits to represent the year in date values. Dates where written in the form DD-MM-YY this caused fear that6 calculations may yield unexpected results as calculating the age of a person born in 1974 may use a calculation that yields sth like 00-74. Organizations hired task groups to change the date format too DD-MM-YYYY.
3. __Adaptive__
	aims to the system in response to a change in the environment:
	- new legislative rules
	- technological changes, ex: updating a system from Python 2.7 to Python 3.0
	- customization demands from new customers
4. __Refactoring__
	Refactoring involves changes in a program that doesn't change any external behavior. But makes it easier to maintain and read. By:
	- Changing variable names
	- Splitting a large method into smaller ones-
5. __Evolutionary__
	- add new features to a system or significantly enhance existing ones
	- to preserve system's value for customers
