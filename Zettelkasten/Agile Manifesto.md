# Agile Manifesto

> Through this work, we have come to value:
> 
> **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
> 
> **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
> 
> **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
> 
> **Responding to change** over following a plan.

### Reason 
- After the [[CHAOS Report 1994]] and the realization by software engineers at the time that software development differs significantly from other engineering disciplines
	- Due to the constant evolution of  software projects than other engineering projects. (Changeability)
	- Customers often lack a clear understanding of their needs.

Software has essential difficulties that are unlikely to be solved. ![[No Silver Bullet#Examples of Essential Difficulties]]
