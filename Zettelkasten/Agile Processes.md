# Agile Processes
>To address the problems posed by the [[Waterfall Processes]],  Agile recommends building software incrementally and iteratively, with validation by users at every iteration.

### Agile Methods
- Various Methods have been derived from these principles like [[XP (SW Engineering)]], [[Scrum]], [[Kanban]].
- Promoted automated testing
- test-driven development
	writing tests before the actual code
- continuous integration
	Recommends that developers push the code to the main repository continuously (every day, for example). To avoid integration conflicts.
### History:
- In February 2001, a group of 17 SW engineers devised an alternative approach called Agile.
