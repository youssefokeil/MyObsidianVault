# Vectorized Environments (RL)
> Vectorized Environments are a method for stacking multiple independent environments into a single environment. Instead of training an RL agent on 1 environment per step, it allows us to train it on `n` environments per step. `actions`, `observations`, `rewards` and end of episode signals `dones` are now all vectors of dimension `n`.
