2. It can make so much good to the world. If AI is able to do research, it can research meat alternatives to shut factory farms, we can research ways to provide food and shelter for everyone on the world. We can research ageing and cure killer diseases.
3. Working with cutting-edge technologies is fun.
4. For protecting national interests and staying relevant at the global stage.
5. Solving custom problems for people.
