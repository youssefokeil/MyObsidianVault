# Readable & Documented Code
common recommendations for making your code readable and have good style.
- Make source files not too long
- Lines not too wide
- Put comments whenever *appropriate* `//` or multi-line `/* */` (NB comment blocks have an extra asterisk `/** .... comments here.....*/`)
- Make code that is self-documenting by picking appropriate variable and function names. ex: `getUserName` instead of `f` and `year` instead of `x`
