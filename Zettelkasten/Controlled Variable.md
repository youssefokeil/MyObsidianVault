# Controlled Variable
> is the output of the control system, as it is the variable that is measured and controlled. In control systems, we usually try to make the variable follow a reference or a trajectory.

### Examples of control variables:
- Temperature in thermal process (plant).
- Flow rate, level (or pressure) in hydraulic process.
- Flow rate or gas pressure in [[pneumatic process]].
- Electric current and voltage in electrical process.
- Displacement & speed (linear or angular) in mechanical process.
