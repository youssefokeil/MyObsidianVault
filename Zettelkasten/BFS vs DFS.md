# BFS vs DFS

|                                                  | BFS                  | DFS                 |
| ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------- | ------------------- |
| Solution not far from root of tree               | Better               |                     |
| Tree us very deep and solutions are rare         | Better               | extremely long time |
| If the tree is very wide (high branching factor) | Need too much memory | better              |
| Solutions are frequent but deep in the tree      | impractical          | better              |
