# The Effect of The Industrial Revolution (Engels)
1. lower prices of industrial products brought about by machine labor totally destroyed, the old system of manufacture based on hand labor.
	- countries that are strangers to historical development like India, China has bought those machines and bought the cheaper commodities of the English. Allowing their industries to be revolutionized and destroy their own manufacturing workers.
	- Allowed all the people of earth to be in contact with each other. Merging all local markets into one world market. Now whatever happens in one country has repercussions in other countries.
2. Whenever  big industries displaced manufacture, the bourgeoisie developed wealth and power to the utmost and made itself the first class of the country.
	- allowed the bourgeoisie to take political power into its own hands & displace the ruling class.
	- This removed the ruling class; 
		- the aristocracy; by abolishing the involvement of states, by making landed property subject to purchase.
		- the guild masters; by abolishing guilds (نقابات). Putting competition, in its place, which is a state of society where everyone can enter any branch of industry (if he has the necessary capital).
		- the absolute monarchy. Instead, we had the "constitutional monarchy", only who possess certain capital are voters. 
3. The proletariat develops in step with the bourgeoisie.
	- In proportion to the growth of wealth of the bourgeoisie, the proletariat grows in numbers.
	- Engels assumes that capital extends only through employing power, it follows that growth of proletariat proceeds with the same pace as growth of capital.
4. The more labor-saving machines are invented, the greater the pressure on wages. This renders the condition of the proletariat increasingly unbearable.
5. More was produced than was needed.
	1. As a multitude of capitalists invaded industry, as production was facilitated. 
	2. More products were manufactured than what was needed. 
	3. This caused the factories to be closed and their owners going bankrupt. 
	4. After a time the "extra" products  were sold, and factories began to operate again. Wages rose and business got better.
	5. step 2 happens again
	Every 5 to 7 years, a fresh crisis has intervened. This caused the greatest hardship for workers, and revolutionary stirrings to change the existing order of things. 

## Periodic Commercial Crises:
As point 5 indicated, every 7 years we have a fresh crisis with a lot of hardships.
