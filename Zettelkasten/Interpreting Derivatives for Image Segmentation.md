# Interpreting Derivatives for Image Segmentation
### First-order derivatives
- first-order derivatives generally produce thicker edges, than second derivatives.
### Second-order derivatives
- are much more aggressive than first-order in enhancing sharp edges. So it enhances fine details, noise & isolated points much more than the first-order derivatives.
- the sign of the second derivative is used to determine whether an edge is a transition from light to dark (negative second derivative), or from dark to light (positive second derivative)
- Second-order derivatives produce a double-edge response at ramp & step transitions in intensity. This is an important characteristic to locate edges.

### Detection of Isolated Points:
if we want to detect isolated points, we can use the second derivative.
