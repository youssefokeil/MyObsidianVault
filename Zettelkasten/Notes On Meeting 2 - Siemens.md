# Notes On Meeting 2 - Siemens
1. the learning phase is so tight
2. The literature review is also very short
3. discuss the possibility of making the first semester not have a prototype but mainly studying and literature review.
4. put links of papers and published dates in slides
5. LLMs that are general purpose, can be used to modify and make testbenches. Try to use something like that where it was built for a purpose and you use it for another purpose.
