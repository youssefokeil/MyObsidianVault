# Concentrated AI Wealth
Wealth due to AI will likely be highly concentrated
1. Automation will decrease the share of a company's income that goes towards wages, and increase the share of income that gets paid to the company's owners.
2. The nature of AI industries could further inequality. AI industries, like other digital technology industries, has features of an oligopoly.
3. Since ML is increasingly becoming more general, this means that data will be more valuable (because the data can train the model to get better in other adjacent domains not just the one at hand). Meaning companies will be less open-source and the economy will favor companies that are able to collect data, house databases and train their models on big GPU clusters. Not companies that can focus on one thing of those.
