# Finding A Mentor
>Mentor: A person who's good in something you want to learn, do and agrees to help you and advise you.
### Tips To Find Them:
1. Shouldn't be in the same country or continent as you.(use the internet)
2. There's always a trade-off between searching for a person having the same learning journey as you, and a person who will have different ideas and give you insights from another place..
3. AMAs(ask me anything), forums, books, GitHub are the best way to get ideas from world-class professionals.
4. Try to be concise as possible when you ask a professional in order not to take from his time. But we recommend doing [[Permissionless Apprenticeship]]
