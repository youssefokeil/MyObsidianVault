# The Origin of Morality
```timeline
+ Pre-1987
+ How children develop thinking about rules?
+ The big question behind research at this period was, how children came to know right from wrong? There were two obvious answers. 
- From nature, which is called nativism. It argues that moral knowledge is native to our minds, preloaded.
- From nurture, in what is called as empiricism. Believing that children are blank slates at birth & they learn morality from experience, including adults telling us right from wrong

+ In 1987
+ The argument for rationalism
+ The third answer, was rationalism. Meaning that kids figure out moral reasoning for themselves. One of the leading figures for this argument was Jean Piaget & the [[Piaget's Experiments]].
