# Evolutionary Methods
> Are when a large collection of non-learning agents using different [[Policy-Based Method#Policy|policies]] are all interacting with the environment. Now the agents that get the highest reward are picked.

## Why is it called evolutionary?
Because it's analogous to how biological evolution works, given that there is no learning in their individual lifetimes.
## When is it suitable?
- if space of policies is sufficiently small, or good policies are easy to find
- a lot of time is available for search
