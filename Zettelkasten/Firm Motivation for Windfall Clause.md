# Firm Motivation for Windfall Clause
By agreeing to be bound by a Windfall Clause, a signatory would send a convincing, costly signal of the firmâ€™s intention to ethically develop AI. Most companies agree on the need to regulate AI, but observers see it as "ethics theater". Here we will see how companies can be motivated to sign something like the [[Windfall Clause]].
1. Generating goodwill for the signatory as a justification for [[Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)]] 
	some studies find there is a positive correlation between CSR efforts and the company's financial performance. So it's a sound business strategy.
2.  Attracting top talent
	top researchers prefer working for socially responsible firms. The godfather of AI, Geoffrey Hinton, left Google so that he can talk safely about AI safety. Also top talent can agree to be paid less in order to work with firms that have good reputation. (One study found that 38% lower wages are paid by reputable companies than ones with poor reputation)
3. Reducing political risk through activism, it reduces the risk of seizure of foreign companies by host governments
	Silicon valley companies have been antagonized because of tax avoidance, invading users' privacies, skewing democracy and concentrating market power through monopolies.
