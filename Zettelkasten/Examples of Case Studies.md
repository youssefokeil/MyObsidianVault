# Examples of Case Studies

### Stories We Tell:
In the every day reference to an event or story illustrative of a particular incident or experience of a person. Lots of people associate case studies with a story.

### Individual Cases in Professions:
- In healthcare, it is often called _case histories._ Record a person's reaction to situations and medication. A great deal of confidentiality is important in that context.
- In law, it is often called _case precedent,_ to support an argument being made. Those are often publicly documented.
### In Teaching:
- _Case exemplars,_ offer brief descriptions in some detail to a person or project's experience in an area of practice.
- _Case scenarios,_ outlining a particular problem for _management_ student to resolve.
#### Why?
- Invite students to do specific tasks and think about things they're doing.
	- giving space for students to analyze and solve relevant real-world practical problems.
- Active learning technique for students to apply what they learn.
- Cases are used in problem-based learning. To put your students in shoes of relevant decision-makers. Occasionally, they provide references to problem confronted. 
### Country Case Studies:
In contexts like [[OECD]], examining education or environmental science in one or several companies.
- May be a contemporary study or what transpired of a program over a period of time.
- Tend to be more knowledge and information rather than based on experience.

### Case Study as History:
This is closer to research context. It is likely to be supported by documentary evidence not primary data.
