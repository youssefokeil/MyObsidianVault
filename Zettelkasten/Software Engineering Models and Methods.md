# Models
> Provides a higher-level representation of a system than its source-code, Enabling developers to analyze a system's properties and characteristics without immersing themselves in the details of the source code.

### Graphical Notations
software models use graphical notations like [[UML]], a notation featuring diagrams to model structural and behavioral properties of a software project.
- Models can be created before the source code, supporting _Forward Engineering_
- Or after the code, to understand the existing code, using _Reverse Engineering_
