One egg, one embryo, one adult—normality. But a bokanovskified egg will bud, will proliferate, will divide. From eight to ninety-six buds, and every bud will grow into a perfectly formed embryo, and every embryo into a full-sized adult. Making ninety-six human beings grow where only one grew before. — location: [89]() ^ref-58720

‘Bokanovsky’s Process is one of the major instruments of social stability!’ — location: [103]() ^ref-60777

Standard men and women; in uniform batches. The whole of a small factory staffed with the products of a single bokanovskified egg. — location: [105]() ^ref-57520

The principle of mass production at last applied to biology. — location: [109]() ^ref-28539

You should see the way a negro ovary responds to pituitary! — location: [123]() ^ref-9243

‘Eighty-eight cubic metres of card-index,’ said Mr. Foster with relish, as they entered. ‘Containing all the relevant information,’ added the Director. — location: [138]() ^ref-56012

that fruit of delayed development, the human intelligence. — location: [199]() ^ref-40391

---
‘Hasn’t it occurred to you that an Epsilon embryo must have an Epsilon environment as well as an Epsilon heredity?’ — location: [192]() ^ref-23238

---
But though the Epsilon mind was mature at ten, the Epsilon body was not fit to work till eighteen. — location: [201]() ^ref-29403

‘that is the secret of happiness and virtue—liking what you’ve got to do. All conditioning aims at that: making people like their unescapable social destiny.’ — location: [217]() ^ref-62742

---
For particulars, as every one knows, make for virtue and happiness; generalities are intellectually necessary evils. Not philosophers, but fret-sawyers and stamp collectors compose the backbone of society. — location: [66]() ^ref-22840

Result: they’re decanted as freemartins−structurally quite normal — location: [179]() ^ref-24024

‘The lower the caste,’ said Mr. Foster, ‘the shorter the oxygen.’ — location: [194]() ^ref-34028

---
By the time they were decanted the embryos had a horror of cold. They were predestined to emigrate to the tropics, to be miners and acetate silk spinners and steel workers. — location: [214]() ^ref-19450

A special mechanism kept their containers in constant rotation. ‘To improve their sense of balance,’ — location: [230]() ^ref-3487

The idea was to make them want to be going out into the country at every available opportunity, and so compel them to consume transport. — location: [284]() ^ref-40260

---
Primroses and landscapes, he pointed out, have one grave defect: they are gratuitous. A love of nature keeps no factories — location: [287]() ^ref-4728

---
The problem was to find an economically sounder reason for consuming transport than a mere affection for primroses and landscapes. — location: [290]() ^ref-33020

‘In brief,’ the Director summed up, ‘the parents were the father and the mother.’ — location: [303]() ^ref-2254

‘The principle of sleep-teaching, or hypnopædia, had been discovered.’ — location: [315]() ^ref-52995

You can’t learn a science unless you know what it’s all about. — location: [333]() ^ref-9467

---
Elementary Class Consciousness.’ — location: [344]() ^ref-19026

---
But wordless conditioning is crude and wholesale; cannot bring home the finer distinctions, cannot inculcate the more complex courses of behaviour. For that there must be words, but words without reason. In brief, hypnopædia. — location: [359]() ^ref-48850

---
‘Suggestions from the State.’ He banged the nearest table. ‘It therefore follows — location: [368]() ^ref-2990

erotic play between children had been regarded as abnormal (there was a roar of laughter); — location: [402]() ^ref-37033

This is the Controller; this is his fordship, Mustapha Mond.’ — location: [415]() ^ref-17449

---
Mustapha Mond! The Resident Controller for Western Europe! One of the Ten World Controllers. — location: [423]() ^ref-48515

---
The D.H.C. looked at him nervously. There were those strange rumours of old forbidden books hidden in a safe in the Controller’s study. Bibles, poetry—Ford knew what. — location: [436]() ^ref-38905

---
‘Just try to realize it,’ he said, and his voice sent a strange thrill quivering along their diaphragms. ‘Try to realize what it was like to have a viviparous mother.’ — location: [442]() ^ref-57232

---
Psychically, it was a rabbit hole, a midden, hot with the frictions of tightly packed life, reeking with emotion. — location: [464]() ^ref-37369

---
Lenina shuddered. ‘How I loathe intravenals, — location: [478]() ^ref-49424

---
Family, monogamy, romance. Everywhere exclusiveness, everywhere a focussing of interest, a narrow channelling of impulse and energy. — location: [496]() ^ref-23723

---
‘And I jolly well don’t see why there should have been.’ — location: [503]() ^ref-39456

---
it really won’t do. And you know how strongly the D.H.C. objects to anything intense or long-drawn. — location: [507]() ^ref-18069

what with all the diseases and the endless isolating pain, — location: [515]() ^ref-2672

The machine turns, turns and must keep on turning—for ever. It is death if it stands still. A thousand millions scrabbled the crust of the earth. — location: [524]() ^ref-28826

hadn’t been feeling very keen on promiscuity lately. There are times when one doesn’t. Haven’t you found that too, Fanny?’ — location: [536]() ^ref-31347

‘No pains have been spared to make your lives emotionally easy—to preserve you, so far as that is possible, from having emotions at all.’ — location: [545]() ^ref-52037

---
‘And then he spends most of his time by himself—alone.’ There was horror in Fanny’s voice. — location: [557]() ^ref-15709

---
‘Has any of you been compelled to live through a long time-interval between the consciousness of a desire and its fulfilment?’ — location: [562]() ^ref-54005

---
‘Has any of you ever encountered an insurmountable obstacle?’ — location: [561]() ^ref-13670

There was something called Christianity. Women were forced to go on being viviparous.’ — location: [573]() ^ref-42472

There was something called democracy. As though men were more than physico-chemically equal.’ — location: [585]() ^ref-2395

In the nurseries, the Elementary Class Consciousness lesson was over, the voices were adapting future demand to future industrial supply. — location: [604]() ^ref-61691

---
‘Every man, woman and child compelled to consume so much a year. In the interests of industry. The sole result — location: [613]() ^ref-21473

---
For example, there was the conscription of consumption.’ — location: [610]() ^ref-43217

---
‘Back to culture. Yes, actually to culture. You can’t consume much if you sit still and read books.’ — location: [618]() ^ref-61241

---
‘the Controllers realized that force was no good. The slower but infinitely surer methods of ectogenesis, Neo-Pavlovian conditioning and hypnopædia . . — location: [626]() ^ref-4937

‘Accompanied by a campaign against the Past; by the closing of museums, the blowing up of historical monuments (luckily most of them had already been destroyed during the Nine Years’ War); — location: [632]() ^ref-51029

‘The ethics and philosophy of under-consumption — location: [646]() ^ref-17615

‘We have the World State now. And Ford’s Day celebrations, and Community Sings, and Solidarity Services.’ — location: [651]() ^ref-19374

‘One cubic centimetre cures ten gloomy sentiments,’ — location: [670]() ^ref-50873

‘Along with them all the old man’s mental peculiarities. Characters remain constant throughout a whole lifetime.’ — location: [677]() ^ref-54624

---
‘Now—such is progress—the old men work, the old men copulate, the old men have no time, no leisure from pleasure, not a moment to sit down and think — location: [683]() ^ref-23937

there is always soma, delicious soma, — location: [684]() ^ref-59307

‘I suppose we take the Blue Pacific Rocket? Does it start from the Charing-T Tower? Or is it from Hampstead?’ — location: [711]() ^ref-58067

The liftman slammed the gates, touched a button and instantly dropped back into the droning twilight of the well, the twilight of his own habitual stupor. — location: [720]() ^ref-14838

Reality for Benito was always sunny. — location: [732]() ^ref-16054

They were flying over the six kilometre zone of park-land that separated Central London from its first ring of satellite suburbs. — location: [753]() ^ref-52055

---
One of the huge travelling crucibles was being tapped as they flew over. — location: [759]() ^ref-44419

---
Those who meant well behaved in the same way as those who meant badly. — location: [770]() ^ref-49765

---
Wretched, in a word, because she had behaved as any healthy and virtuous English girl ought to behave and not in some other, abnormal, extraordinary — location: [774]() ^ref-4137

---
To have dealings with members of the lower castes was always, for Bernard, a most distressing experience. — location: [778]() ^ref-49887

---
Would the creature treat him with the respect due to his caste? The question haunted him. — location: [783]() ^ref-5594

---
Which in turn increased his sense of being alien and alone. — location: [787]() ^ref-14699

---
That which had made Helmholtz so uncomfortably aware of being himself and all alone was too much ability. — location: [814]() ^ref-17087

---
or rather, since it was always Helmholtz who did all the talking, to listen to his friend discussing, yet once more. — location: [820]() ^ref-60991

---
You can’t imagine what a hullabaloo they’ve been making about it at the College. Still, it’s been worth it, I think. The effects . — location: [831]() ^ref-45397

---
‘Well, they’re odd, they’re very odd.’ — location: [832]() ^ref-11823

---
Mental excess could produce, for its own purposes, the voluntary blindness and deafness of deliberate solitude, the artificial impotence of asceticism. — location: [833]() ^ref-22212

---
‘You mean all the emotions one might be feeling if things were different?’ — location: [839]() ^ref-52858

---
feeling that I’ve got something important to say and the power to say — location: [840]() ^ref-40028

almost as though you’d sat on a pin, they seem so new and exciting even though they’re about something hypnopædically obvious. — location: [843]() ^ref-6217

You read and you’re pierced. That’s one of the things I try to teach my students—how to write piercingly. — location: [848]() ^ref-43162

‘If you knew what I’d had to put up with recently,’ — location: [856]() ^ref-54085

‘On their way up the chimney the gases go through four separate treatments. P2O5 used to go right out of circulation every time they cremated some one. Now they recover over ninety-eight per cent. of it. More than a kilo and a half per adult corpse. Which makes the best part of four hundred tons of phosphorus every year from England alone.’ — location: [876]() ^ref-7138

---
‘Yes, everybody’s happy now,’ echoed Lenina. They had heard the words repeated a hundred and fifty times every night for twelve years. — location: [901]() ^ref-2330

---
Lenina and Henry were yet dancing in another world—the warm, the richly coloured, the infinitely friendly world of soma-holiday. How — location: [923]() ^ref-31923

Ford, we are twelve; oh, make us one,   Like drops within the Social River; Oh, make us now together run   As swiftly as thy shining Flivver. — location: [970]() ^ref-29402

Come, Greater Being, Social Friend,   Annihilating Twelve-in-One! We long to die, for when we end,   Our larger life has but begun. — location: [976]() ^ref-41645

After a pause, sunk to a whisper, but a whisper, somehow, more penetrating than the loudest cry. — location: [998]() ^ref-24790

Tenderly the deep Voice crooned and cooed; in the red twilight it was as though some enormous negro dove were hovering benevolently over the now prone or supine dancers. — location: [1024]() ^ref-29919

but of balanced life, of energies at rest and in equilibrium. — location: [1029]() ^ref-24838

He had emerged from that crimson twilight into the common electric glare with a self-consciousness intensified to the pitch of agony. — location: [1035]() ^ref-44956

---
And even then, how inadequately! A cheap week-end in New York—had it been with Jean-Jacques Habibullah or Bokanovsky Jones? She couldn’t remember. Anyhow, — location: [1045]() ^ref-52630

---
Pretty harmless, perhaps; but also pretty disquieting. That mania, to start with, for doing things in private. Which meant, in practice, not doing anything at all. For what was there that one could do in private. — location: [1055]() ^ref-48674

---
‘I’d rather be myself,’ he said. ‘Myself and nasty. Not somebody else, however jolly.’ — location: [1068]() ^ref-48926

---
‘It makes me feel as though . . — location: [1082]() ^ref-42052

More on my own, not so completely a part of something else. Not just a cell in the social body. — location: [1083]() ^ref-18178

‘why you don’t take soma when you have these dreadful ideas of yours. You’d forget all about them. And instead of feeling miserable, you’d be jolly. So jolly,’ — location: [1099]() ^ref-55518

---
Not that he himself saw anything intrinsically objectionable in people talking about the remote past; that was one of those hypnopædic prejudices he had (so he imagined) completely got rid of. — location: [1148]() ^ref-45055

---
Because, after all, it’s the sort of accident that might have happened to any one; and, of course, the social body persists although the component cells may — location: [1163]() ^ref-44886

Nothing emotional, nothing long-drawn. It was all perfectly healthy and normal.’ — location: [1170]() ^ref-63595

Alphas are so conditioned that they do not have to be infantile in their emotional behaviour. — location: [1174]() ^ref-10602

in the thought that he stood alone, embattled against the order of things; elated by the intoxicating consciousness of his individual significance and importance. — location: [1180]() ^ref-46223

This boasting, for example. And the outbursts of an abject self-pity with which it alternated. — location: [1189]() ^ref-1685

Often in the past he had wondered what it would be like to be subjected (soma-less and with nothing but his own inward resources to rely on) — location: [1246]() ^ref-48581

They’ve got enough experience of gas bombs to know that they mustn’t play any tricks.’ — location: [1274]() ^ref-41721

At their feet lay a straggle of low buildings, a criss-cross of walls; and on three sides the precipices fell sheer into — location: [1281]() ^ref-27551

‘But cleanliness is next to fordliness,’ she insisted. ‘Yes, and civilization is sterilization,’ — location: [1310]() ^ref-33666

sunken orbits his eyes were still extraordinarily bright. They looked at her for a long moment expressionlessly, without surprise, as though she had not been there at all. — location: [1325]() ^ref-44482

---
Bernard proceeded to make open comments on this revoltingly viviparous scene. — location: [1331]() ^ref-15975

---
Shutting her eyes she abandoned herself to their soft repeated thunder, allowed it to invade her consciousness more and more completely, till at last there was nothing left in the world but that one deep pulse of sound. — location: [1348]() ^ref-30959

---
Hideously masked or painted out of all semblance of humanity, they had tramped out a strange limping dance round the square; — location: [1357]() ^ref-25823

A great yell went up from the crowd, and all the other dancers ran towards him with outstretched hands. — location: [1362]() ^ref-38842

Then the leader gave a signal, and one after another, — location: [1365]() ^ref-8929

And slowly, raised by invisible hands from below, there emerged from the one a painted image of an eagle, from the other that of a man, naked, and nailed to a cross. — location: [1368]() ^ref-10066

The coyote struck again, again; and at every blow at first a gasp and then a deep groan went up from the crowd. The — location: [1375]() ^ref-31981

And to please Pookong and Jesus. — location: [1400]() ^ref-2499

Some hunters from Malpais had found her and brought her to the pueblo. As for the man who was his father, Linda had never seen him again. — location: [1411]() ^ref-6942

---
Linda had come from the Other Place long ago, before he was born, with a man who was his father. — location: [1409]() ^ref-15055

---
He must have flown away, back to the Other Place, away without her—a bad, unkind, unnatural man. — location: [1412]() ^ref-26642

---
She shuddered. It was worse than the old man. So fat. And all the lines in her face, the flabbiness, the wrinkles. And the sagging cheeks, with those purplish blotches. And the red veins on her nose, the bloodshot eyes. — location: [1420]() ^ref-48152

seeing that I did all the Malthusian drill—you know, by numbers, One, two, three, four, always, I swear it; but all the same it happened; and of course there wasn’t anything like an Abortion Centre here. — location: [1437]() ^ref-4386

And in the end I suppose I got used to it. And anyhow, how can you keep things clean when there isn’t hot water laid on? — location: [1448]() ^ref-47942

---
And you’re supposed to mend it if it gets torn. But I’m a Beta; I worked in the Fertilizing Room; nobody ever taught me to do anything like that. — location: [1449]() ^ref-53368

“The more stitches, the less riches.” Isn’t that right? Mending’s anti-social. — location: [1451]() ^ref-19236

‘nobody’s supposed to belong to more than one person. And if you have people in the ordinary way, the others think you’re wicked and anti-social. — location: [1457]() ^ref-9238

‘They’re so hateful, the women here. Mad, mad and cruel. And of course they don’t know anything about Malthusian drill, — location: [1460]() ^ref-47114

Even though they always were so beastly to him and wouldn’t let him do all the things the other boys — location: [1466]() ^ref-4208

---
There’s so much one doesn’t know; it wasn’t my business to know. I mean, when a child asks you how a helicopter works or who made the world—well, what are you to answer if you’re a Beta and have always worked in the Fertilizing Room? What are you to answer?’ — location: [1467]() ^ref-18008

after her. He asked her why they were angry. ‘Because I broke something,’ she said. And then she got angry too. ‘How should I know how to do their beastly weaving?’ she said. — location: [1494]() ^ref-1175

---
Popé used to come often. He said the stuff in the gourd was called mescal; but Linda said it ought to be called soma; only it made you feel ill afterwards. — location: [1499]() ^ref-31080

---
Once, twice, three times; and each time Linda screamed. — location: [1506]() ^ref-65422

---
The whip whistled again, fell. But this time it was Linda who screamed. — location: [1510]() ^ref-21653

But he was also crying because people were so beastly and unfair, and because he was only a little boy and couldn’t do anything against them. — location: [1511]() ^ref-7161

‘They say those men are their men,’ she went on; and she did not seem to be talking to him at all; she seemed to be talking with some one inside herself. — location: [1515]() ^ref-55927

He remembered the first time she found those little animals in his hair, how she screamed and screamed. — location: [1529]() ^ref-26262

‘But I can read,’ he said to himself, ‘and they can’t. They don’t even know what reading is.’ — location: [1557]() ^ref-25458

Linda never seemed to know. The old men of the pueblo had much more definite answers. — location: [1567]() ^ref-26572

I expect it’s true, because I looked at it, and it seemed to be full of nonsense. Uncivilized. — location: [1575]() ^ref-51753
