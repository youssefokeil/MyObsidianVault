Actually Do Something on the following day. Others are people who feel guilty whenever they stop working before they literally fall over from exhaustion, and — location: [21]() ^ref-26122

---
In this book, I’m going to explore a whole slew of tools for removing guilt-based motivation and replacing it with something that is both healthier and stronger. — location: [24]() ^ref-32840

---
I’m aiming to help people feel like they’re still worthwhile human beings if they stop working before they literally drop. — location: [27]() ^ref-48876

listlessness, the vague feeling of guilt that one might get when they play videogamesallday,orwhentheyturndesperatelytowardsdrugsorparties, in attempts to silence the part of themselves that whispers that there must be something else to life. — location: [30]() ^ref-50591

---
In my experience, this listless guilt tends to be found in people who have fallen into the nihilistic trap—people who either believe they can’t matter, or who believe that no one can matter. — location: [35]() ^ref-52530

So, of course, the philosophers started calling it the “stamp collector.” Then,oneday, — location: [42]() ^ref-47633

Once upon a time, a group of naïve philosophers found a robot that collected trinkets. — location: [39]() ^ref-35015

---
It can only ever act according to a model of the world that it reconstructs inside its head!” — location: [47]() ^ref-43894

---
That would be impossible, because its inventory is outside of its head. Rather, it must be maximizing itsinternal stamp counterinside its head.” — location: [50]() ^ref-12138

The robot is not occupied by some homunculusthat has dominion over the innards but not the outards! — location: [54]() ^ref-60957

register holding the stamp counter and “fake” access to the inventory. — location: [55]() ^ref-63366

---
First of all, these naïve philosophers have made the homunculus error. — location: [52]() ^ref-3129

And yet, humans have a bad habit of explaining confusing things in terms of themselves. — location: [61]() ^ref-52978

You can’t explain why a wall is red by saying “because it’s made of tiny red atoms;” — location: [59]() ^ref-48611

---
It must be by choosing outcomes in which the stamp counter is higher!” and in doing so, they have explained choice in terms of choice, rather than in terms of something more basic. — location: [63]() ^ref-25833

---
That model of the world contains a representation of how many stamps are in the inventory. — location: [66]() ^ref-12432

---
and thenpredicts how that outcome would affect some specific place in internal memory, — location: [70]() ^ref-10855

---
So I gave the robot the following options: take one stamp, or take zero stamps and I’ll increase the stamp counter by ten. Guess which one it took? — location: [75]() ^ref-10270

---
“… Huh! That means that the stampyness of refusing to have the stamp counter tampered with must worth be more than 10 stamps!” — location: [77]() ^ref-60378

---
“Why, stampyness is the robot’s internal measure of how much taking a certain action would increase its stamp counter.” — location: [78]() ^ref-17780
