## Chapter 3: The Nature of Matter
### The problem:
Hardness, color and sound are appearance of a physical object. We assume that there is something else, of which those things are appearances.

What is the nature of this real object; which exists independently of our perception?

### An attempt to solve it:
**Physical science** provides us an an answer that is incomplete, true and very hypothetical. 

*For light* ---> reduced to wave-motions.
This, however, is not enough as what we mean by light can't be just reduced to wave-motions. When we explain to the blind man wave-motions, he'll not get what we mean by light. 

The blind man can know space by touch, waves by experiencing sea waves. But this will not be enough to understand light and what we mean by it.'

We can say that wave-motions are the the physical cause of our sensation of light. But light itself, doesn't form any part of the world independent of us and our senses.

All other senses are not existent in the physical world: colors, sounds and space.

*Space* ---> essential for science that matter exists in space, but space that is different from what we hear or feel. 

Everybody has his own *apparent space*, but science concerns itself with the *real space*.

We may assume that physical space in which physical objects have spatial relations correspond to those with corresponding sense-data in private space.
