## Highlights
The proletariat is that class in society which lives entirely from the sale of its labor-power1 and does not draw profit from any kind of capital; whose weal and woe, whose life and death, whose sole existence depends on the demand for labor-power— — location: [21]() ^ref-27473

---
But there have not always been workers and poor people living under conditions as they are today; — location: [25]() ^ref-56367

---
How did the proletariat originate? The Proletariat originated in the industrial revolution, which took place in England in the last half of the 18th century, — location: [27]() ^ref-45575

---
This industrial revolution was precipitated by the discovery of the steam engine, various spinning machines, the mechanical loom, and a whole series of other mechanical devices. — location: [30]() ^ref-5910

---
The machines delivered industry wholly into the hands of the big capitalists and rendered entirely worthless the meager property of the workers (tools, looms, etc.). — location: [33]() ^ref-33366

---
Labor was more and more divided among the individual workers so that the worker who previously had done a complete piece of work now did only a part of that piece. — location: [38]() ^ref-20403

---
It reduced the activity of the individual worker to simple, endlessly repeated mechanical motions which could be performed not only as well but much better by a machine. — location: [39]() ^ref-51887

---
But at the same time, they also fell into the hands of big capitalists, and their workers were deprived of whatever independence remained to them. — location: [42]() ^ref-7043

---
came within the province of the factory system as big capitalists increasingly displaced the small master craftsmen by setting up huge workshops, — location: [43]() ^ref-16861

---
This process has, to an ever-greater degree, ruined the old middle class, especially the small handicraftsmen; — location: [46]() ^ref-62585

---
The class of the wholly propertyless, who are obliged to sell their labor-power to the bourgeoisie in order to get, in exchange, the means of subsistence for their support. This is called the class of proletarians, or the proletariat. — location: [51]() ^ref-23588

---
The class of big capitalists, who, in all civilized countries, are already in almost exclusive possession of all the means of subsistence and of the instruments (machines, factories) and materials necessary for the production of the means of subsistence. — location: [49]() ^ref-557

---
In a regime of big industry or of free competition—as we shall see, the two come to the same thing—the price of a commodity is, on the average, always equal to its cost of production. — location: [55]() ^ref-56937

---
the costs of production of labor-power consist of precisely the quantity of means of subsistence necessary to enable the worker to continue working, — location: [57]() ^ref-27892

---
The worker will therefore get no more for his labor-power than is necessary for this purpose — location: [58]() ^ref-47487

---
This economic law of wages operates the more strictly the greater the degree to which big industry has taken possession of all branches of production — location: [63]() ^ref-30680

---
In antiquity, the workers were the slaves of the owners, just as they still are in many backward countries and even in the southern part of the United States. — location: [66]() ^ref-35641

---
The individual slave, property of one master, is assured an existence, however miserable it may be, because of the master’s interest. — location: [72]() ^ref-30364

---
property as it were of the entire bourgeois class, which buys his labor-power only when someone has need of it, has no secure existence. — location: [73]() ^ref-26850

---
while the proletarian belongs to a higher stage of social development and, himself, stands on a higher social level than the slave. — location: [77]() ^ref-13811

---
The proletarian works with the instruments of production of another, for the benefit of this other, in exchange for a part of the product. — location: [81]() ^ref-10495

---
The serf possesses and uses an instrument of production, a piece of land, in exchange for which he gives up a part of his product or part of the services of his labor. — location: [80]() ^ref-21342

---
In contrast to the proletarian, the so-called handicraftsman, as he still existed almost everywhere in the 18th century and still exists here and there at present, is a temporary proletarian at most. — location: [87]() ^ref-49778

---
capital himself to then exploit other workers. He can often achieve this goal where guilds still exist or where freedom from guild restrictions has not yet led to the — location: [89]() ^ref-11458

---
But as soon as the factory system has been introduced into the crafts and competition flourishes fully, this perspective dwindles away and the handicraftsman becomes more and more a proletarian. — location: [91]() ^ref-29891

---
an instrument of production in his own possession: his loom, the family spinning wheel, a little plot of land which he cultivated in his spare time. — location: [96]() ^ref-8820

---
The manufacturing worker almost always lives in the countryside and in a more or less patriarchal relation to his landlord or employer; — location: [98]() ^ref-53973

---
First, the lower and lower prices of industrial products brought about by machine labor totally destroyed, in all countries of the world, the old system of manufacture or industry based upon hand labor. — location: [102]() ^ref-11833

---
India—were thoroughly revolutionized, and even China is now on the way to a revolution. — location: [106]() ^ref-22592

---
England deprives millions of Chinese workers of their livelihood within a year’s time. — location: [107]() ^ref-52245

---
big industry has brought all the people of the Earth into contact with each other, has merged all local markets into one world market, has spread civilization and progress everywhere and has thus ensured that whatever happens in civilized countries will have repercussions in all other countries. — location: [108]() ^ref-42450

---
Second, wherever big industries displaced manufacture, the bourgeoisie developed wealth and power to the utmost and made itself the first class of the country. — location: [112]() ^ref-56458

---
The result was that wherever this happened, the bourgeoisie took political power into its own hands and displaced the hitherto ruling classes, the aristocracy, the guildmasters, and their representative, the absolute monarchy. — location: [113]() ^ref-60402

Involvement

from now on, the members of society are unequal only to the extent that their capitals are unequal, — location: [119]() ^ref-26500

---
destroyed the power of the guildmasters by abolishing guilds and handicraft privileges. — location: [117]() ^ref-21790

---
that is, a state of society in which everyone has the right to enter into any branch of industry, the only obstacle being a lack of the necessary capital. — location: [117]() ^ref-22509

---
Free competition is necessary for the establishment of big industry, because it is the only condition of society in which big industry can make its way. — location: [121]() ^ref-6251

---
This it does through the introduction of the representative system which rests on bourgeois equality before the law and the recognition of free competition, — location: [124]() ^ref-13860

---
In these constitutional monarchies, only those who possess a certain capital are voters; that is to say, only members of the bourgeoisie. — location: [125]() ^ref-34573

---
In proportion, as the bourgeoisie grows in wealth, the proletariat grows in numbers. — location: [129]() ^ref-30853

---
by capital, and since capital extends only through employing labor, — location: [130]() ^ref-26127

This is not true as cappital can expand by scientific innovtions and by the removal of labor

---
Moreover, the further this process advances, the more labor-saving machines are invented, the greater is the pressure exercised by big industry on wages, which, as we have seen, sink to their minimum and shortly render the condition of the proletariat increasingly unbearable. — location: [133]() ^ref-40550

---
With production thus facilitated, the free competition, which is necessarily bound up with big industry, assumed the most extreme forms; a multitude of capitalists invaded industry, and, in a short while, more was produced than was needed. — location: [138]() ^ref-51617

---
After a time, the superfluous products were sold, the factories began to operate again, wages rose, and gradually business got better than ever. — location: [141]() ^ref-15886

---
nearly every five to seven years, a fresh crisis has intervened, always with the greatest hardship for workers, and always accompanied by general revolutionary stirrings and the direct peril to the whole existing order of things. 13. — location: [145]() ^ref-3164

---
First: That, though big industry in its earliest stage created free competition, it has now outgrown free competition; — location: [147]() ^ref-55341

---
it can be maintained only at the cost of general chaos every seven years, — location: [150]() ^ref-4760

---
impossibility, or that it makes unavoidably necessary an entirely new organization of society in which production is no longer directed by mutually competing individual industrialists, — location: [152]() ^ref-21895

---
Second: That big industry, and the limitless expansion of production which it makes possible, bring within the range of feasibility a social order in which so much is produced that every member of society will be in a position to exercise and develop all his powers and faculties in complete freedom. — location: [154]() ^ref-57280

---
private property owners expresses itself, it follows — location: [167]() ^ref-55658

---
in a different form of society, will abolish this misery and these catastrophic depressions. — location: [157]() ^ref-34687

---
That all these evils are from now on to be ascribed — location: [159]() ^ref-26492

---
That it is possible, through a new social order, to do away with these evils altogether. — location: [161]() ^ref-42275
